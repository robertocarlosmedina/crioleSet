Astronomers Introduction Introduction video What is Astronomy?
Often considered the oldest science, it was born of our amazement at the sky and our need to question Astronomy is the science of space beyond Earth’s atmosphere.
The name is derived from the Greek root astron for star, and nomos for arrangement or law.
Astronomy is concerned with celestial objects and phenomena – like stars, planets, comets and galaxies – as well as the large-scale properties of the Universe, also known as "The Big Picture".
More specifically, astronomy is the study of the origin and evolution of the Universe, the physics and chemistry of celestial objects, and the calculation of their positions and motions.
For most people, astronomy represents a world that is both mysterious and grandiose – a story about glimmering celestial objects and the immensity of the cosmos.
It prompts us to ask the deepest existential questions:
Who are we?
Where did we come from?
Are we alone?
The lure of these universal enigmas was the spark that ignited the passion of many of today’s famous astronomers.
Astronomy also plays a much more practical role that is not nearly as important today as it was in the past.
Since the time of our earliest ancestors, humans have used the motions of celestial objects to position themselves in space and time.
Prehistoric humans studied the relationship between the seasons and the length of days to plan their hunting and gathering activities.
It was also by observing the positions of the stars that the first farmers decided when to plant and when to harvest, and early navigators could sail the oceans blue.
In the Age of Antiquity, astrometry – the measurement of the positions of stars and planets – was the main occupation of astronomers.
There was some degree of interest for astronomy from the general public as well, since they believed that the positions of celestial objects influenced events that took place on Earth.
During the Renaissance, advances in mathematics coupled with the invention of new observational instruments (like the refracting telescope) gave rise to modern astronomy.
From the 19th century onwards, the discovery of the electromagnetic spectrum and the world of the atom spurred on the development of astrophysics, a new discipline in astronomy that is now considered to be the most important.
Today, astronomy covers several disciplines:
◦ Astrometry, which is the precise measurement of the position of stars and planets, and which is greatly facilitated by the use of modern CCD cameras and computers
◦ Stellar astronomy, which is the study of the origins and evolution of stars
◦ Galactic astronomy, which studies the structure and components of galaxies
◦ Astrophysics, which studies the Universe and the physics of its constituents (luminosity, temperature, chemical composition)
◦ Cosmology, which studies the origin and evolution of the Universe as a whole Related to these fields of research are two disciplines that lie more within the domain of geologists and biologists: planetary science, which is the study of asteroids, comets and planets, and astrobiology, which studies the possibility of life in the Universe.
Nowadays, professional astronomers have a strong background in astrophysics and their observations are almost always examined in an astrophysical context.
The most serious amateurs actively participate in the study of variable stars, the discovery of new asteroids or comets, and other exciting astronomical work.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first astronomical observations in Canada The era of explorers and Jesuits The history of Canadian astronomy began when the first European explorers used astronomical observations to guide them over the ocean and to navigate our waterways.
John Cabot, who discovered Newfoundland in 1497, and Jacques Cartier, who explored further inland by way of the Saint-Lawrence River in 1534, were undoubtedly the first explorers that used astronomical instruments to locate the landmass now known as Canada.
It was also during the Champlain era that French missionaries, the Jesuits, first set foot on Canadian soil in 1604.
By 1618, they had begun to record astronomical observations (most notably about comets and eclipses) and included them in the reports sent back to France (titled Relations in French).
In 1634, astronomy officially became a part of the tasks assigned to Jean Bourdon, the Engineer-in-Chief and Land Surveyor for the New France colony in Quebec.
During the time of the early settlers, the function of astronomy was primarily practical.
It was the science of colonization par excellence, used to draw up accurate geographic maps and to tell time precisely.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The first observatories The first astronomical observatory in North America was Canadian It is difficult to confirm with certainty the very first astronomical observatory in Canada.
The Jesuit priest Joseph-Pierre de Bonnécamps, who taught at the College of Quebec from 1750 to 1759, had obtained a number of astronomical instruments with the intention of constructing an observatory on the college roof.
Bonnécamps left Canada in 1759 not long before the fall of Quebec at the hands of the British, and he never returned.
The British closed the College of Quebec and the teaching tasks were transferred to the Seminary of Quebec across the street.
There is mention of an "observation chamber" in the Seminary archives of 1770, which may be a reference to the existence of an astronomical observatory.
Evidence for another early observatory can be found in a wood engraving from a book by the Marquis de Chabert de Cogolin that dates from the time he was at the Fortress of Louisbourg (1750-1751).
Chabert owned several such instruments and it is likely that a temporary observatory existed for a short time in the fortress.
The first North American observatory that existed with historical certainty was at Castle Frederick, the estate founded by Joseph DesBarres at Falmouth, Nova Scotia, in 1765.
Later records describe an observatory on Quebec’s Île Jésus (now "Laval") that was established by Dr. Charles Smallwood de Saint-Martin.
Historical evidence suggests that it was already in existence by 1846.
There is also evidence that in 1849, Dr. James Toldervy of Fredericton, New Brunswick, created an observatory in his garden near the Saint John River.
A year later, in 1850, the Quebec City Observatory was established on the Plains of Abraham.
Built in such a way as to be visible from the port and the Saint Lawrence River, the structure included a large ball that signalled midday when it dropped.
Historical records report the establishment of seven other major observatories from 1850 to the end of the century.
They are: 1.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Observatory The first government observatory and provider of official time in Canada The Dominion Observatory was founded in 1905 in Ottawa, Ontario.
The impetus for Canada’s first government observatory came from the Geological Survey of Canada, which had a pressing need for a service that could supply precise temporal and spatial coordinates for its mapping and topographic surveys.
In those days, only observatories were capable of providing such a service.
William Frederick King, Chief Astronomer for the Department of the Interior, played a key role in setting up the new observatory.
He became its first Director and equipped it with a 35-centimetre telescope, the largest ever installed in Canada.
The first mandate of the observatory was to determine and distribute the exact time to the rest of the country.
King confided this task to Robert Meldrum Stewart, the astronomer who went on to become Director from 1923 to 1946.
More specifically, it was necessary to know the exact moment when certain stars passed their highest point in the sky (the meridian); these were known as "transit times".
Due to the conscientious observation of transit times for many stars, and to the acquisition of a high precision clock in 1929, Stewart gradually established a network of clocks throughout Ottawa’s federal government buildings.
A signal from the observatory’s clock was electronically transmitted to the buildings; in this way, about 700 clocks in Ottawa were able to display precise time by 1930.
After 1941, this time service was extended to the entire country and the Dominion Observatory became the official supplier of time for Canada.
In order to fulfill its second mandate – to provide spatial coordinates for the country – the Dominion Observatory set out to determine the precise position of 3,162 stars in the sky.
This was accomplished by recording 28,000 astronomical observations from 1911 to 1923.
A new project was launched in 1923, and the positions of another 1,368 stars were measured until 1950.
These data – combined with the knowledge of exact time – allowed longitude, latitude and elevation to be calculated with precision for many points across Canada.
As part of its responsibility to the Geological Survey of Canada, the Dominion Observatory was also entrusted with a third mandate: to collect seismic, gravimetric and magnetic geophysical data.
Among the noteworthy events that marked the history of the Dominion Observatory were the apparent discovery of "Planet X" in 1928, the determination of the solar rotation as a function of latitude in the 1930’s, and the discovery of numerous meteor impact sites in Canada.
Scientific institutions in Canada were reorganized in 1970 and the responsibilities of the Dominion Observatory were transferred to the National Research Council of Canada (NRC).
The observatory ceased its activities and the building became the headquarters for the NRC.
In 1974, the telescope was moved to the Helen Sawyer Hogg Observatory of the Canadian Museum of Science and Technology where it remains to this day.

Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory The first Canadian observatory of international calibre, it once housed the largest telescope in the world The Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1918 at Saanich near Victoria, British Columbia.
Its creation was motivated by the growing need of Canadian astronomers to have access to a large world-class telescope.
The observatory immediately achieved international status by housing a 1.83-metre telescope that was the largest operating telescope in the world, although it only held this title for a few months.
The installation of the telescope was largely the work of celebrated Canadian astronomer John Stanley Plaskett, and the instrument was baptized the "Plaskett Telescope" in his honour.
It measured 15 metres long and its mobile parts weighed 42 tonnes.
Plaskett became the first Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory and helped it establish an international research reputation very early on.
In 1922, for example, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star.
This celestial body bears the name of "Plaskett’s Star" in his honour.
During subsequent years, Plaskett established the radial velocities of several stars (that is, the speed at which the stars are moving away or toward the observer) and demonstrated that our galaxy, the Milky Way, is rotating.
He was also the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 the distance from the centre of our galaxy to its edge, and that our solar system takes approximately 22 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
In 1940, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory was the site of two other major discoveries.
Andrew McKellar, one of the observatory’s astronomers, became the first researcher to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectral bands for the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
One year later, in 1941, he determined the temperature of the cyanogen molecules and deduced that the interstellar environment in which they are found is very cold, approximately -270 °C.
It was the first direct measurement of the temperature of the Universe.
In 1962, the observatory acquired a second telescope measuring 1.22 metres in diameter.
Equipped with only a spectroscope, it was mainly used to study binary stars.
In 1970, the responsibility of the observatory was conferred to the National Research Council of Canada.
In 1981, the observatory received a third telescope measuring 40 centimetres across.
It was primarily used for scientific research, notably the study of gas clouds in our galaxy (the Milky Way), and to test instruments destined for large telescopes.
Today it is used to show the sky to the general public.
In 1995, the observatory became the headquarters for the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, which operates several telescopes (optical and radio) in Canada and shares many others with various countries elsewhere in the world, including the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Gemini telescopes.
In 2001, the observatory inaugurated an interpretation centre open to the general public all year long and affectionately named "The Centre of the Universe".
It includes a small planetarium and offers interactive displays, multimedia presentations and special events designed to introduce people from all walks of life to the world of astronomy.
Over the years, new instruments were added and many technical improvements were made to the Plaskett Telescope, the observatory’s main telescope.
Today, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory is the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The David Dunlap Observatory Home to the largest optical telescope in Canada The David Dunlap Observatory opened its doors in 1935 near the small town of Richmond Hill, 25 kilometres north of Toronto, Ontario.
The facility was the property of the University of Toronto and was operated by the astronomy department.
It was created to conduct astronomical research, to assist in the advanced education of university students, and to stimulate the public’s interest in astronomy.
The observatory was mainly the work of Clarence Augustus Chant, a Canadian astronomer and astronomy professor at the University of Toronto.
In 1921, while campaigning to establish a large telescope observatory in the Toronto region, Chant managed to get David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, interested in the project.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924, but his widow, Jessie, took up the cause and worked for the next ten years with Chant to make sure the project succeeded.
The observatory was inaugurated the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctorate from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed a 1.88-metre telescope, the second largest in the world after the Mount Wilson telescope in the United States, and Canada thus owned two of the four largest telescopes in the world.
The building that houses the administrative offices of the observatory was also inaugurated in 1935.
Over the years, more and more radio astronomers were joining the astronomy department at the University of Toronto, and in the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory actively participated in the development of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario.
By the end of the 1960’s, the David Dunlap Observatory, being located near the major urban centre of Toronto, found itself plagued with the problem of light pollution.
The observatory responded in 1971 by erecting a 60-centimetre telescope at Las Campanas in Chile.
The David Dunlap Observatory thus acquired international status and the skies of the south were available to Canadian astronomers for the first time.
A spectacular discovery was made at the David Dunlap Observatory in 1972.
Charles Thomas Bolton, one of the observatory’s astronomers, discovered Cygnus X-1, the first black hole ever identified.
In 1987, the observatory was responsible for another amazing discovery thanks to its telescope in Las Campanas.
Ian Shelton, one of the astronomers from the University of Toronto, was using the Chilean telescope when he observed a supernova (1987 A) in the Greater Magellan could.
The discovery made headlines around the world, as it was the first supernova visible to the unaided eye in almost 400 years.
Unfortunately, financial problems forced the David Dunlap Observatory to cease operations at Las Campanas in 1997.
The National Observatory of Argentina took charge of the telescope and moved it from Chile to Parque El Leoncito in Argentina.
The David Dunlap Observatory nonetheless retains one quarter of the observation time at the telescope.
Today, the David Dunlap Observatory of Toronto is still active thanks in part to a light pollution abatement program initiated by Charles Thomas Bolton.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Algonquin Radio Observatory Home to the largest parabolic antenna in Canada The Algonquin Radio Observatory was inaugurated in 1959 at Traverse Lake in the Algonquin National Park in Ontario.
It was created by the National Research Council of Canada for Canadian radio astronomers who needed a site in Ontario where radio interference would be minimal.
The first director was Arthur Edwin Covington, Canada’s first radio astronomer.
More than a decade earlier, in 1946, Covington had collected data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) from a site in Ottawa, and again in 1947 from Goth Hill south of Ottawa.
His work became of paramount importance when he demonstrated that the intensity of solar radiation was related to the Sun’s magnetic activity, which had (and still has) crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems and power lines.
The Traverse Lake site in Algonquin National Park was selected for the Algonquin Radio Observatory due to its relative isolation from manmade interference.
Covington installed a parabolic mirror with a diameter of 1.83 metres in 1960 and began moving his equipment from Goth Hill in 1962.
The radio telescopes operated continuously at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres, which is an ideal wavelength for monitoring solar activity due to the Sun’s particular chemical composition.
In 1966, an array consisting of 32 parabolic antennas, each 3 metres in diameter, was added to the observatory.
The goal was to refine the measurements from other radio telescopes by scanning the Sun’s surface every noon at a wavelength of 10.7 centimetres.
Operating at a wavelength of 2 centimetres, it was used to study galactic and extragalactic objects that emit radio waves, such as quasars.
In 1968, the 46-metre radio telescope was used in conjunction with the 26-metre instrument at the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory of Penticton, British Columbia, to simulate the resolution of a giant 3,074-kilometre radio telescope (the physical distance separating the two instruments).
It was the first successful long distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
The goal of the experiment was to discern a source of radio waves with great precision.
Very large antennas are necessary to precisely determine the position of radio sources because radio waves have much larger wavelengths than visible light waves, and because the detection of any object in space depends largely on the size of the observation instrument (that is, its lenses, mirrors or radio antennas).
The 1970’s marked a time of increased collaboration between the Algonquin Observatory radio astronomers and the researchers at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Many new complex chemical compounds were identified for the first time in interstellar gas clouds thanks to the collaborative effort.
After planning to resurface the 46-metre radio telescope so that it could operate at wavelengths as small as 3 millimetres, the National Research Council of Canada decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987 and purchase a 25% share in the new James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory, which would include a radio telescope that could operate at 0.3 to 2 millimetres.
In 1990, the work of collecting data on the Sun’s radio flux moved to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1991, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was finally closed, but the 46-metre antenna is nonetheless still active as part of a continental network of antennas that precisely measures movements of the North American tectonic plate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory The largest radio astronomy observatory in Canada The Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1960 at White Lake near Penticton, British Columbia.
The creation of the observatory was primarily the work of Carlyle Smith Beals, an astronomer who wanted to advance the field of astrophysics in Canada.
The first parabolic antenna, measuring 25.6 metres, began operating in 1960.
It was mainly designed to operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Radio astronomers at Penticton have been striving towards this goal since the first days of the observatory.
In 1962, a second radio telescope was put in place.
Fully operational in 1964, it consisted of 1,700 cedar posts that extended for 1.3 kilometres in the shape of a "T" to cover a surface area of 65,000 square metres.
The posts supported a network of several thousand metres of metallic wires formed the antenna of the radio telescope.
This radio telescope was primarily used between 1965 and 1969 during a period when solar spots were at a minimum.
In fact, it is only during these periods of low solar activity that very long radio waves from space can pass through the atmosphere to reach Earth’s surface.
The main goal of the T-shaped radio telescope at Penticton was to produce a map of radio sources in our galaxy.
It was also used to observe several hundred specific radio sources, such as quasars and distant galaxies.
In 1965, a 1.8-metre parabolic antenna was installed to collect data on solar radiation.
In 1968, the 25.6-metre radio telescope at Penticton was used in conjunction with the 46-metre telescope at the Algonquin Radio Observatory to simulate the resolution of a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres (the physical distance between the two instruments).
The antennas would operate at a wavelength of 21 centimetres, which corresponds to one of the spectral lines of hydrogen.
Today, the synthesis array radio telescope consists of seven 8.5-metre parabolic antennas that can operate continuously, 24 hours a day, at two wavelengths (21 and 74 centimetres).
From 1995 to 2005, the radio telescope was mainly used in the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, the goal of which is to map a large portion of the Milky Way.
In 1990, following the closure of the Algonquin Radio Observatory, the task of gathering data on the Sun’s radio flux (the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths) was transferred to the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory at Penticton.
The observatory is now under the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory An example of a successful partnership The Rothney Astrophysical Observatory was inaugurated in 1972 at Priddis, a small locality 75 kilometres southwest of Calgary, Alberta.
Belonging to the University of Calgary, the facility was operated by the astronomy and physics departments.
The objectives the observatory were the advanced education of university students and the pursuit of astronomical research.
In 1970, Alexander Rothney Cross, a wealthy rancher, donated land to the University of Calgary for the purpose of constructing the observatory.
Work commenced in 1971 and the university took the opportunity to simultaneously start an undergraduate degree in astronomy.
The observatory opened its doors in 1972 to display a dome housing a 41-centimetre telescope, and an adjacent lecture room.
The first research activities were mostly on photometry.
The year of 1981 was particularly fruitful for the observatory.
The National Research Council of Canada decided to finance the construction of a new facility that would house a 1.5-metre telescope capable of operating in the infrared range.
Alexander Rothney Cross signed on to the project by making another donation.
The Canadian Forces Base Cold Lake also provided a gift: a Baker-Nunn camera that the Armed Forces had used to track satellites in the sky.
The new facility was constructed by the physics department of the University of Calgary.
Construction continued for several years and by 1987 the 1.5-metre telescope was operational.
The physics department changed its name to the Department of Physics and Astronomy.
Most of the research work focused on the study of stars, X-ray sources, possible black holes and planetary nebulas.
The telescope was still equipped with a metal mirror (not glass), and its optical qualities were considered less than optimal by that time.
The decision was made at the end of the 1980’s to replace it with a new 1.8-metre mirror.
The new mirror was delivered to the observatory in 1993, and once again, Alexander Rothney Cross contributed to the project.
Construction was completed by the workshop of the Department of Physics and Astronomy, and the telescope became operational in 1996.
The following year, it was baptized as the Alexander Rothney Cross Telescope in honour of the generous benefactor.
The new telescope is used to observe (among other things) gravitational lenses, asteroids, comets and variable stars, and is also used in the search for planets outside our solar system.
Recent developments include a new Visitor’s Centre that was inaugurated in 2003.
The 41-centimetre telescope continues to be operational and is used to track asteroids that orbit near Earth and represent a possible danger.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Mont-Mégantic Observatory The largest astronomical observatory in eastern North America The Mont-Mégantic Observatory was opened in 1978 near Sherbrooke, Quebec.
It was created to promote university-level astronomy education in Quebec, to provide qualified astronomers with state of the art research equipment, and to promote astronomy among French Canadian citizens.
The telescope is equipped with a 1.6-metre mirror that weights one metric ton; the entire structure weighs 24 tonnes.
The Mont-Mégantic Observatory houses the largest telescope in eastern North America, and the fourth largest in Canada after those of the David Dunlap Observatory in Toronto (1.88 metres), the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria (1.83 metres), and the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (1.8 metres).
Although not the biggest, the state of the art instruments attached to the Mont-Mégantic telescope make it the most powerful telescope in Canada.
The project to construct a large observatory in Quebec was launched in 1971 by professors Gilles Beaudet and George Michaud of the University of Montreal.
Laval University in Quebec City joined the venture in 1974 and a partnership agreement was signed in 1975.
The federal and provincial governments approved the project in 1976, and construction started the same year.
The service building was completed in 1977, and the observatory several months later in 1978.
René Racine joined the project in 1973 and became Director in 1976, the same year he left the University of Toronto to work at the University of Montreal.
A dynamic instrument program also accounts for a large part of Mégantic’s productivity.
In 1991, for example, the observatory became the first in Canada to use an infrared camera.
Named MONICA (for MONtreal Infrared Camera), it was designed by Daniel Nadeau and René Doyon of the University of Montreal.
The site at Mont-Mégantic is particularly favourable for infrared astronomy because interference radiation levels are very low during the long cold nights in winter (sometimes even lower than the levels at Mauna Kea in Hawaii).
In 1996, the Mont-Mégantic ASTROLab, an astronomy activity centre, opened its doors to the general public.
The centre hosts interactive displays, a high definition movie, multimedia presentations and access to two public observatories during open house astronomy evenings.
Visitors can also tour the observatory and its 1.6-metre telescope during the day.
In 1999, a major 3-year renovation program was started.
First, the dome of the 1.6-metre telescope was repaired and equipped with a ventilation system.
Then, in 2000, the observatory was linked to universities by fibre optics.
A year later, the telescope controls became fully computerized and a new bonnet (the interface that allows instruments to be coupled to the telescope) was installed.
Following this, a number of new state of the art instruments were also added to the telescope.
Asteroid 4843 is named in honour of the observatory.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory One of the most powerful and productive observatories in the world The Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory began operating in 1979 atop the Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
Canada’s participation meant valuable access to a world-class telescope for Canadian astronomers.
At the time of its inauguration, the 3.6-metre telescope was the sixth largest in the world and operated in the range of visible light and infrared.
France launched the project in 1970 with the purchase of a 14-tonne glass disk.
The state of Hawaii joined the project in 1971, followed by Canada in 1973.
The three partners signed an agreement in 1974 and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation was born.
Canada was in charge of polishing the mirror, putting into place a control system for the telescope, and constructing the observatory building.
France was responsible for constructing specific mechanical parts for the telescope (tube, frame, etc.), and Hawaii provided the site, a road to the site, and several instruments.
The telescope’s mobile component weighed 250 tonnes and the total structure weighed 325 tonnes.
In 1977, the headquarters and a library were set up at Waimea near the observatory.
Canada was granted access to 42.5% of the available observation time, France 42.5%, and the United States 15%.
In 1996, an adaptive optics system was installed on the telescope that would once again rival the Hubble Space Telescope in the production of the highest resolution astronomical images.
These new improvements quickly bore fruit for the Canada-France-Hawaii Observatory as it was involved in discovering – or confirming the discovery of – many new moons, gravitational lenses, and so on.
For example, astronomers Brett J. Gladman and John J. Kavelaars discovered three new satellites around the planet Uranus in 1999 (Prospero, Setebos, and Stephano) and eight around Saturn in 2000 (Siarnaq, Tarvos, Ijrak, Thrymr, Skathi, Mundilfari, Erriapo and Suttungr).
The discoveries of other moons around Uranus and Neptune were announced in 2001 and 2002, but have not yet been confirmed.
In 2003, a new imaging system known as MegaPrime was installed.
MegaPrime uses the French-designed MegaCam camera that is able to take 340-million pixel images (about 18,400 x 18,400 pixels), making it the most powerful camera of its type in the world.
These days, the observatory is involved in the study of the solar system, the birth and evolution of stars, the interstellar medium, the structure and content of galaxies, galaxy clusters, and large-scale structures of the Universe.
The Canadian participation in the observatory is managed by the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory The largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The James-Clerk-Maxwell Observatory was inaugurated in 1987 near the summit of Mauna Kea volcano in Hawaii.
The observatory is named after James Clerk Maxwell, a Scottish physicist who was famous for his groundbreaking work in electricity and magnetism.
At the time of the observatory’s construction, the National Research Council of Canada was planning to resurface its 46-metre radio telescope at the Algonquin Radio Astronomy Observatory.
The goal of the resurfacing program was to increase the resolution of the telescope so that it could observe wavelengths as small as three millimetres.
Upon learning of the capabilities of the new British-Dutch radio telescope, the Council decided instead to close the Algonquin Observatory in 1987and to purchase a 25% share in the James-Clerk-Maxwell Telescope.
The JCMT would suit the needs of Canadian astronomers because it was to operate at wavelengths in the submillimetre to lower microwave range (between 0.3 to 2 millimetres).
Canada currently has access to 22.5% of observation time, the United Kingdom 49.5%, the Netherlands 18%, and the international community 10%.
A piece of Gore-TexTM (the largest in the world) is permanently attached to the building’s opening, which protects the telescope from wind and dust but still allows it to "see" the sky.
Gore-Tex allows 97% of submillimetre waves to pass through and does not interfere with the operation of the radio telescope.
The number one enemy of a radio telescope is water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere because it easily absorbs submillimetre waves.
To minimize this effect, the observatory is located at an elevation of 4,092 metres: 97% of atmospheric water vapour exists below this elevation and thus below the observatory.
The main use of radio telescopes is to study our solar system (the Sun, planets and comets), interstellar matter, distant galaxies, quasars, and cosmic background radiation.
The government organization responsible for Canadian participation in the radio telescope is the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory Perfecting the next generation of super telescopes The University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory was established in 1995 at Maple Ridge, approximately 60 kilometres east of Vancouver.
The goal of the observatory is to develop and test new liquid mirror telescopes.
Liquid mirror telescopes are part of the next generation of super telescopes.
A liquid mirror is made of a strongly reflective liquid (like mercury, for example) that rotates so that its surface curves and takes the shape of a paraboloid, which will direct and concentrate light to the focal point of a telescope.
This type of mirror has a major advantage over conventional mirrors in that it is much cheaper to build (up to 100 times less expensive).
In 1982, Ermanno Franco Borra, a professor in the Physics Department at Laval University in Quebec, revived the historical proposal of creating liquid mirror telescopes and sought to demonstrate the feasibility of such a project.
Several liquid mirrors were subsequently developed at Laval University in the 1980’s.
In 1994, Paul Hickson of the University of British-Columbia completed the construction of the first liquid mirror telescope in collaboration with Borra.
The mirror measured 2.64 metres in diameter.
The following year, Hickson installed his telescope in the newly inaugurated University of British-Columbia Liquid-Mirror Observatory.
The efforts of Hickson and his collaborators culminated in 2004 when the 6-metre liquid mirror Large Zenith Telescope went into operation.
The Large Zenith Telescope is the third largest optical telescope in North America and the largest liquid mirror telescope in the world.
Despite its enormous size, the mirror components weigh only 3 tonnes.
At the present time, the observatory is involved in two large-scale projects.
The first is the construction of the ALPACA telescope (Advanced Liquid-mirror Probe for Astrophysics, Cosmology and Asteroids), which consists of a liquid mirror measuring 8 metres in diameter.
The array will simulate a telescope measuring 50 metres in diameter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Gemini North and South Observatory A pair of giant observatories – one in each hemisphere – to provide full sky coverage As the name would suggest, Gemini (which means "twins" in Latin) is the name given to two astronomical observatories.
The locations of these two observatories provide complete access to the sky from both hemispheres.
The idea to construct the two observatories arose in the mid-1980’s.
The venture really got going in 1990 when an agreement was signed between the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Observation time is distributed in these same proportions.
Gemini North saw first light in 1999, whereas Gemini South opened a year later in 2000.
The instruments on each telescope, however, are not necessarily the same (cameras, spectrometers, etc.). One of the main contributions made by Canada was to provide an adaptive optics system: a system that corrects image distortion due to turbulence in Earth’s atmosphere.
The construction of the dome, the support, the subterranean facilities and the system that controls the rotating part of each telescope was also Canada’s responsibility.
The system consists of 120 hydraulic jacks under the mirror that provide constant adjustments to restore it to a perfect shape.
The adjustments are typically on the order of one thousandth the width of a human hair.
The observatories were specifically designed to observe visible light, but also infrared light.
Clouds of gas and dust hide large sectors of space, like the regions where stars and planets are forming, or the cores of galaxies that contain quasars and black holes.
Infrared light is of great interest to astronomers because it is able to penetrate these clouds and reveal details that would otherwise be invisible.
The reflecting surface of the Gemini mirrors is made of a thin film of silver that reflects infrared rays better than aluminum, and the domes of the observatories are a metallic grey colour instead of the traditional white to keep the temperature of the telescopes constant.
Moving hatches allow the observing slits to open across the entire dome.
All these finishing touches make the Gemini telescopes expensive instruments to operate.
It currently costs about $50,000 for a single night of observation at one of the telescopes.
Astronomers, however, do not have to spend this amount themselves: user fees for a Gemini telescope are paid by the national agencies that finance the observatory.
Canadian participation in the Gemini telescopes is currently the responsibility of the National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics Video sequence Jean-René Roy talks about the Gemini telescopes.
The satellite, which weighs 1,360 kilograms, was designed to last three years.
It was the result of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and France.
John Hutchings, an astronomer from the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s project scientist.
As the name would suggest, FUSE is an observatory with a mission to study distant sources of ultraviolet radiation, specifically in the range of 9 to 12 millionths of a centimetre.
This portion of the electromagnetic spectrum has been little studied up to this point, mainly because the ozone layer in Earth’s atmosphere absorbs most of the ultraviolet rays that arrive from space.
Ultraviolet light is also particularly difficult to collect.
It becomes increasingly difficult for a mirror to reflect light at very short wavelengths because the waves tend to "slide" between the atoms of the reflecting surface.
X-rays, which are found immediately after ultraviolet rays in the electromagnetic spectrum, have such short wavelengths that they pass right through objects (of course this is also the very property that makes them so useful in medicine).
The FUSE Space Telescope consists of four mirrors specially designed for reflecting ultraviolet light.
Two mirrors are coated with silicon carbide, whereas the other two are coated with lithium fluoride over aluminum.
The FUSE Observatory is 10,000 times more sensitive than the Copernicus satellite (1972-1981), which was the last satellite to observe the sky in ultraviolet light.
The Canadian contribution consists of two fine guidance sensors that allow the space observatory to be aimed at its targets with a very high degree of precision.
This contribution guarantees Canada at least 5% of the available observation time.
The primary mission for FUSE is to analyse the amount of deuterium ("heavy" hydrogen) in the Universe in order to better understand the activity of stars since the Big Bang.
The amount of deuterium has been continually decreasing since the formation of the Universe as the nuclear processes in stars destroy it.
The observatory is also used for other research projects.
In 2000, for example, the telescope was used to discover an explosion involving thousands of stars has left a colossal halo of burning gas the shape of a football extending up to 5,000 to 10,000 light-years above and below the Milky Way.
The observatory is still functioning today, despite numerous setbacks that can be expected given its advanced age.
Video sequence John Barrie Hutchings explains what FUSE is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory The only underground Canadian observatory The Sudbury Neutrino Observatory began operating in 1999 at a depth of 2,070 metres below the surface in the Creighton mine near Sudbury, Ontario.
The goal of the observatory is to detect and study neutrinos emitted by the Sun and other celestial objects.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom.
Neutrinos are small elementary particles that are electrically neutral (that is, they have no electrical charge).
So little, in fact, that matter is virtually transparent to them, and therein lies the difficulty in detecting neutrinos.
Stars produce large amounts of neutrinos.
The Sun, for example, emits 200 trillion trillion trillion neutrinos each second.
Billions of neutrinos pass through the Sun, the Earth and your body every instant without being hindered.
In fact, during your entire lifetime, only one or two neutrinos will ever come into contact with one of the atoms in your body.
One of the major unresolved problems about our Sun is related to its production of neutrinos.
In the early 1980’s, it was realized that the number of solar neutrinos detected by various laboratories were less than predicted by theoretical calculations.
Two hypotheses were proposed: either that our knowledge of the Sun is insufficient, or that some of the neutrinos change their form during their voyage to the Earth (this phenomenon is known to affect other elementary particles), which would mean that the number of neutrinos reaching Earth is less than the amount originally emitted by the Sun.
In 1983, Canadian researchers proposed the construction of an underground neutrino detector in an Ontario nickel mine belonging to the company Inco.
The underground site would shield the detector from microwaves in the background cosmic radiation, which would normally impede the detection of solar neutrinos.
One year later, in 1984, an American researcher published a study that demonstrated the advantages of using heavy water (water in which the hydrogen atoms each have an extra neutron) as a neutrino detector.
Since Canada has an abundant reserve of heavy water, it was decided that the facility would operate as a heavy water detector.
The United States joined the project, follow by the United Kingdom in 1989.
Work began in 1990 and was completed in 1999.
The detector consists of 1,000 tonnes of ultra pure heavy water enclosed in a transparent plastic vessel measuring 12 metres across.
The vessel is itself enclosed in 7,000 tonnes of ultra pure normal water, lodged in an immense cavity measuring 22 metres wide and 34 metres high (the equivalent of a 10-storey building).
It is the largest underground opening ever excavated at two kilometres depth.
The acrylic vessel is surrounded by a 17-metre geodesic dome equipped with 9,600 detectors that sense the presence of neutrinos.
The frequency of neutrino detection is one per hour.
The results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory have demonstrated that neutrinos do indeed change their form during their trip from the Sun to the Earth, thus putting an end to the debate.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Cosmic Background Imager An observatory for studying the oldest light ever emitted The Cosmic Background Imager was put into service in 2000 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
It was the result of collaboration between the United States, Canada and Chile.
The Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the observatory.
The goal of the Imager is to make a map of the distribution of cosmic background radiation, microwave radiation that represents the aftermath of the Big Bang, the great explosion that gave birth to the Universe.
The Imager is thus studying the oldest light energy ever emitted.
Mapping the distribution of this ancient light – this ancient radiation – effectively allows researchers to "see" what the Universe looked like very shortly after its birth.
This information is extremely important because it helps them better understand the creation, organization and evolution of large structures in the cosmos, such as galaxy clusters.
The observatory’s telescope operates at wavelengths between 0.83 and 1.15 centimetres, which corresponds to the field of microwaves.
It consists of 13 parabolic antennas mounted on a platform measuring six metres in diameter that can be pointed anywhere in the sky.
Each antenna is 90 centimetres across and is lodged in a protective cylinder sealed with a Teflon cover that can transmit microwaves.
In 2002, the telescope detected a pattern in the distribution of background cosmic radiation that revealed structures much smaller than any observed to date.
Researchers also detected a second pattern that could provide new information about the movement of matter shortly after the Big Bang.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Odin Space Observatory An observatory that specializes in research about water and oxygen The Odin Space Observatory was launched into orbit in 2001.
It is a Swedish satellite that was developed in collaboration with Canada, Finland and France; Canada’s contribution is 20%.
It is the first international satellite in which Canada played a major role in design, construction and operation.
The observatory is named after the Norwegian and Germanic god Odin.
Its mission is twofold: the first objective focuses on aeronomy (the study of the atmosphere), and the second on astronomy.
The aeronomic goal is to study certain molecules that are found in Earth’s atmosphere – such as water, chlorine compounds and ozone – which can help us better understand the processes that cause thinning of the ozone layer.
The goal in terms of astronomy is to detect specific molecules in comets, planets, stars, interstellar clouds and galaxies.
The molecules of greatest interest are water and oxygen, because these cannot be studied from Earth’s surface: our atmosphere blocks any radiation emitted by these molecules in space.
All together the satellite weighs 250 kilograms.
Canada’s role in the project began in 1991 when informal discussions began with Sweden about a possible collaboration between the two countries.
An agreement was signed in 1994 that defined Canada’s role and the venture was launched.
Canada provided several instruments, including OSIRIS, which are used to study specific gases and aerosols in Earth’s atmosphere for the aeronomic part of the mission.
The launch was initially planned for 1997, but after several delays and postponements, it finally took place in 2001.
The predicted life expectancy for the observatory was two years (that is, until 2003), but the satellite is still functioning today.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The MOST Space Telescope The first space telescope entirely of Canadian designed and construction The MOST Space Telescope (which stands for Microvariability and Oscillation of Stars) was launched into space in 2003.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
In 1997, the Canadian Space Agency agreed to finance the project and Jaymie Matthews was named Principal Investigator and Mission Scientist.
About the size and shape of a large suitcase, the satellite weighs only 54 kilograms and is equipped with an ultra high precision telescope that measures only 15 centimetres in diameter.
Despite its diminutive size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting the minuscule variations in a star’s luminosity caused by vibrations that shake its surface.
The telescope will complete one orbit around the Earth every 101 minutes by passing over each of Earth’s poles.
It will spend 60 days on each star studied.
Its predicted life expectancy is 5 to 10 years.
The first major discovery made by the telescope occurred as soon as it became operational.
The discovery was that Procyon, one of the most studied stars, shows no pulsations at all, which contradicts 20 years of ideas and observations, and forced astronomers to rethink their models for stars.
In 2005, MOST was responsible for another surprising discovery: it observed a giant planet that orbits so close to its host star that the star was forced to synchronize its rotation with that of the planet.
Normally, it is the other way around: a planet synchronizes its orbit with that of its host star.
Video sequenceJaymie Mark Matthews explains what MOST is.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The Atacama Large Millimeter Array What will be the largest submillimetre radio telescope in the world The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be inaugurated in 2011 at Llano de Chajnantor, a high plateau in the Atacama Desert of northern Chile.
The array should be usable for scientific purposes before its completion, starting in 2007.
The creation of the array is the result of collaboration between Canada, the United States, Europe, Japan and Chile.
The National Research Council of Canada’s Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics is responsible for Canada’s participation in the radio telescope.
The array consists of 62 parabolic antennas measuring 12 metres across and spread out over 14 kilometres in the desert.
They will operate together to simulate a single radio telescope with a diameter of 14 kilometres.
The antennas will operate at wavelengths between 0.00035 and 10 millimetres: that is, from submillimetre wavelengths to the beginning of the microwave range.
Canada will provide 64 ultra-sensitive receptors for the 3-millimetre wavelength range, as well as the image processing software for the radio telescope.
The Atacama Large Millimeter Array will be used to study the formation of planets, stars, distant galaxies, galaxy clusters and interstellar matter.
Astronomers « Return to the observatories The James Webb Space Telescope The successor to the Hubble Space Telescope The James Webb Space Telescope will be launched into space at the beginning of the next decade.
However, it is too far to be repaired and maintained by astronauts, so its life span will only be 5 to 10 years.
The observatory bears the name of James Edwin Webb, director of NASA from 1961 to 1968.
It is the product of a collaborative effort between the United States, Canada and Europe.
John Hutchings, an astronomer with the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, is Canada’s Project Scientist.
At 6.5 metres in diameter, the mirror of the telescope will have a surface seven times greater than that of its predecessor, the Hubble Space Telescope (2.4-metre mirror).
The mirror will consist of 18 small hexagonal mirrors that will deploy and fit together once the telescope is in orbit.
The entire observatory will weigh 6,600 kilograms.
The telescope will operate at wavelengths between 28 thousandths to 6 millionths of a centimetre: that is, from the mid-range of the infrared to almost the beginning of visible red light (Hubble, in contrast, observes at ultraviolet, visible and near-infrared wavelengths).
This range of wavelengths will make it possible to detect extrasolar planets, to conduct detailed studies into the formation of planets and stars, and to study the oldest galaxies lying at the edges of the Universe.
Canadian researchers are also part of the American and European teams in charge of designing other instruments for the space telescope.
Video sequence René Doyon explains what the James Webb Space Telescope is.

The next generation
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers William Frederick King (1854-1916) He raised Canadian astronomy to international stature William Frederick King was born in 1854 at Stowmarket (Suffolk) in England.
His family immigrated to Canada in 1862 and settled down at Port Hope, Ontario.
In 1875, he obtained his bachelor’s degree with high distinctions from the University of Toronto, and he also earned the university’s gold medal in mathematics.
He spent his free time at the university performing complex mathematical calculations for personal amusement.
Later during his career, the University of Toronto awarded him an honorary doctoral degree for his work in astronomy in 1904.
King published many scientific articles on astronomy.
Without doubt, the most significant was his classic article The Geometry of Orbits in which he described a new method for calculating the orbits of binary stars.
The relative obscurity of his scientific career is more than compensated by his famous achievements as astronomer and administrator for the Canadian Government.
It was under his guidance that astronomy really took off in Canada, developing first at the national scale and then rising to international stature.
King entered the Canadian Government as a land surveyor and topographer in 1872 at the age of 18.
He worked on federal lands in western Canada where his knowledge of astronomy was an asset during mapping as it allowed him to determine the longitudes and latitudes of many locations.
He rose step by step through the government echelons until his nomination as Chief Inspector of Surveys for the Department of the Interior in 1886.
In 1887, King began to pressure the government into creating a federal astronomical observatory.
In 1890, he founded the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior with the help of Edward Gaston Daniel Deville and Otto Julius Klotz.
He became its first director that same year and built a small wooden observatory on Cliff Street.
King was nominated seven times as Commissioner of the International Boundary Commission between 1892 and 1908, and he thus helped establish the Canadian-American border.
The world longitude network across the Pacific Ocean was also completed under his direction.
In 1908, he was named Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George for his work.
In 1900, he became founding president of the Ottawa Centre for the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, a position he maintained until his death in 1916.
His efforts to create a large and permanent astronomical observatory bore fruit in 1905 with the inauguration of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
The observatory was equipped with 38-centimetre astronomical telescope and King became its first director.
In 1909, he succeeded where many before him had tried and failed: he founded the Geodetic Survey Division of Canada and became its first director.
Using a variety of methods, including astronomical measurements, the Division managed to precisely determine the position and elevation of many reference points throughout the country, which greatly assisted in the making of geographic maps.
In 1910, only five years after the creation of the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa, King was in charge of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory near Victoria, British Columbia, but died before its inauguration.
In 1911, King was elected President of the Royal Society of Canada, the highest scientific distinction in Canada at the time.
He passed away in Ottawa in 1916 at 62 years old.
« Return to the astronomers Next © 2006 An original idea and a realization of the ASTROLab of Mont-Mégantic National Park
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Stanley Plaskett (1865-1941) He laid the basic foundation for astrophysical research in Canada John Stanley Plaskett was born in 1865 on a farm in Hickson, Ontario.
He began working at the Edison Company (which later become General Electric) in 1886 where he gained experience in mechanics and electricity.
Determined to obtain a university education, he enrolled in the bachelor’s program in 1895 and earned his diploma four years later in 1899 at the age of 33.
Plaskett received four honorary doctoral degrees from Canadian and American universities during his career.
After obtaining his bachelor’s degree, Plaskett taught as a lecturer in the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1903, William Frederick King hired him as part of the Astronomy Division of the Department of the Interior to help design and construct instruments for the new Dominion Observatory in Ottawa.
Plaskett became an invaluable addition to the team thanks to his experience in electricity, mechanics and photography.
Plaskett made his first real foray into astronomy in 1905 at the age of 39.
William Frederick King assigned him the responsibility of astrophysical work at the Dominion Observatory.
During his first research project, he was responsible for studying a total eclipse of the Sun that would be visible from Labrador.
In 1907, after working for two years on a new spectroscope of his own design, Plaskett attached it to the telescope of the Dominion Observatory.
He mainly used it to measure the radial velocities of stars (the speed at which the star is moving away or toward the observer), and managed to collect several thousand spectrograms over the following years.
It quickly became evident, however, that the observatory’s 38-centimetre telescope was not efficient enough for the purpose.
In 1910, Plaskett proposed to William Frederick King that a new giant telescope be constructed.
King was enthusiastic about the idea and the two astronomers began pressuring the Canadian Government to make it a reality.
In 1913, Parliament freed up funds and Plaskett worked for the next five years on the design of a 1.83-metre telescope – the biggest in the world – for the new Dominion Astrophysical Observatory to be built in Victoria, British Columbia.
The new observatory was inaugurated in 1918.
Plaskett continued his work on the radial velocities of stars.
In 1922, he discovered a binary star and the larger of the two still holds the record as the most massive known binary star; it is known today as "Plaskett’s Star".
Between 1928 and 1935, Plaskett published a series of articles with Joseph Algernon Pearce on the radial velocities of stars and confirmed that our galaxy, the Milky Way, rotates.
In fact, he was the first to measure the size, mass and rotational speed of the Milky Way.
He also established that the Sun is located at 2/3 of the distance from the centre of our galaxy, and that our solar system takes approximately 220 million years to complete one galaxial rotation.
He took his retirement in 1935 and died in 1941 in Esquimalt, British Columbia at the age of 75.
In 1988, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Canadian Astronomical Society created the Plaskett Medal, awarded each year to the author of the best doctoral thesis in astronomy or astrophysics at a Canadian university.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Clarence Augustus Chant (1865-1956) The Father of Canadian astronomy Clarence Augustus Chant was born in 1865 at Hagerman’s Corners, Ontario.
He finished high school in 1884 and taught for three years at a school.
He enrolled at the University of Toronto in 1887 and received his bachelor’s degree in 1890.
He secured a job with the Department of Finance in Ottawa, but only stayed for two years.
Chant was determined to obtain a university post, and in 1892, he was hired as a lecturer for the physics department at the University of Toronto.
In 1898, he spent the summer in Germany to study the theory of light, and in 1900 he received his Master’s degree while continuing his role as lecturer.
He left Toronto for Harvard University in the United States and returned the following year, doctoral degree in hand.
His interest for astronomy began in 1892 when he was hired by the physics department of the University of Toronto.
He joined the Physics and Astronomy Society of Toronto, which changed its name to the Astronomical Society of Toronto in 1900, and again to the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1902.
Chant acted as President from 1904 to 1907.
In 1904, Chant suggested that the University of Toronto increase the number of astronomy courses offered by the physics department.
His proposal was well received and six courses were added to the program in 1905.
Until a second professor was hired in 1926, Chant was the sole Canadian professor to train professional astronomers.
It was his role of having taught virtually all the original Canadian astronomers that earned Chant his reputation as the "Father of Canadian astronomy".
No less than five of his former students went on to become directors of astronomical observatories.
In 1906, the lack of a large telescope in the Toronto region prompted Chant to campaign for an astronomical observatory that would be the property of the University of Toronto or the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Meanwhile, in the absence of a suitable telescope, he focused his research on total solar eclipses.
The astronomy department of the University of Toronto was officially established in 1920 and Chant became its first chairman.
The physics department consequently ceased to offer astronomy courses.
In 1921, Chant met David Dunlap, a lawyer and mining entrepreneur, and got him interested in the idea of building a large telescope observatory for the Toronto region.
Unfortunately, Dunlap died in 1924 and seemingly with him any chance of realizing Chant’s goal.
Chant led an expedition to Australia in 1922 to observe a total eclipse of the sun and to verify Einstein’s theory of relativity concerning the deflection of light by a body as massive as a star.
It proved to be one of the first verifications of Einstein’s theory.
In 1928, Chant published Our Wonderful Universe with enormous success, and the book was translated into five languages.
In 1935, the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto was inaugurated on the same day that Chant celebrated his 70th birthday, received an honorary doctoral degree from the University of Toronto, and took his retirement.
At the time of its inauguration, the observatory housed the second largest telescope in the world, measuring 1.88 metres across.
Chant died in 1956 in Richmond Hill, Ontario, at the age of 91.
He published many scientific books and articles, and received numerous awards.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Carlyle Smith Beals (1899-1979) He expanded and developed astrophysics and geophysics in Canada Carlyle Smith Beals was born in 1899 at Canso, Nova Scotia.
He enrolled instead at the University of Toronto and obtained his Master’s degree in 1923.
Beals then returned to the University of Acadia where he was hired as assistant professor in physics.
He only stayed for one year before accepting a job in 1927 at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He stayed at the observatory considerably longer: 20 years, in fact.
Shortly after his arrival, he began to perfect or invent new instruments for the observatory’s telescope.
He established a reliable temperature scale for very hot stars and was the first to demonstrate that their emission spectra are proof that they are surrounded by large gaseous envelopes.
He wrote a thesis on the subject and received a second doctoral degree from the University of London in 1934.
Beals also discovered that the wide emission lines from Wolf-Rayet and P Cygni-type stars are the result of gaseous material ejecting from their surfaces.
He was also the first to recognize that the gas in interstellar space is not uniformly distributed and that it is locally concentrated into clouds that move at high speeds.
In 1940, he became Adjoint Director of the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory of Victoria.
Beals attracted many young researchers to Ottawa, improved the institution’s seismological, gravimetric, magnetic and solar facilities, modernized its official time distribution service, installed new telescopes in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, installed cameras to observe meteors in Alberta, and established the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in Penticton, British Columbia.
In 1956, he began publishing geophysical studies on terrestrial and lunar impact craters, and in so doing demonstrated that meteorite bombardment played a major role in the formation of the planets, including Earth.
Beals retired in 1964 and died in 1979 in Ottawa at the age of 80.
He received many awards for his work in astronomy, geophysics and administration, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 3314 and a lunar crater were named in his honour.
In 1981, the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Carlyle S. Beals Award, given every two years to a Canadian astronomer, or an astronomer working in Canada, in recognition of their outstanding achievement in research.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gerhard Herzberg (1904-1999) He helped make the National Research Council of Canada a world-renowned centre of excellence Gerhard Herzberg was born in 1904 at Hamburg, Germany.
During the early 1920’s, he decided to follow a career in astronomy but was quickly dissuaded by the scarcity of jobs in the field.
He enrolled at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology in 1924 where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in 1927 and a doctoral degree in physical engineering in 1928.
Specializing in atomic and molecular physics, he completed his first postdoctoral position at the University of Göttingen in 1928 and a second postdoctoral assignment at the University of Bristol in 1929.
In 1930, he was hired as a lecturer and assistant to the head of the physics department at the Darmstadt Institute of Technology.
He built a large spectroscopic laboratory and supervised the research of several students and guest researchers.
The German authorities would only allow him to leave with about $2.50, and he sought refuge in Canada where he was offered a guest professorship at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon.
Three months later, he became professor in the physics department, a position he occupied for the next six years.
His work focused mainly on molecular spectroscopy; that is, on the analysis of molecular structure.
More specifically, Herzberg concentrated on the detection and the nature of free radicals.
Free radicals are intermediary molecules in chemical reactions that only exist for several millionths of a second in the laboratory, but much longer in space.
One of his first accomplishments at Saskatoon was to identify the CH+ molecule in interstellar clouds (clouds of gas found between stars).
At the time, only two other molecules had been identified in such an environment.
In addition to the numerous scientific articles that he wrote, he also published three books (1936, 1939 and 1945) that quickly became classics in atomic and molecular spectroscopy.
In 1945, the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago offered Herzberg a position as professor of spectroscopy at their extensive state-of-the-art facilities.
He studied comets and planetary atmospheres by perfecting methods that would go on to become standard techniques used around the world.
In 1948, he returned to Canada and was named Principal Research Officer at the National Research Council, and Director of the Division of Physics shortly afterwards.
He soon began to assemble a group of talented spectroscopists with specialities in various portions of the electromagnetic spectrum (microwaves, infrared, visible light and ultraviolet light), and created research teams in the fields of theoretical and solid state physics.
Herzberg continued to add to his major scientific discoveries: he was the first to detect the hydrogen molecule in planetary atmospheres, the first to uncover the presence of water in comets, and the first to identify dozens of free radicals (including methylene CH2 and methyl CH3) in the laboratory and interstellar clouds.
He also established the National Research Council of Canada as a world leader in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1966, 1971 and 1979, he published three other books that each became a classic in molecular spectroscopy.
In 1969, the National Research Council of Canada created the post of Distinguished Research Scientist for him, which he occupied until his retirement.
In 1974, the Council combined its astronomy and spectroscopy units and created the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics, where he worked until his retirement in 1995.
Herzberg died in Ottawa in 1999 at 94 years old.
He had received numerous distinctions, including the 1971 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
Asteroid 3316 was named in his honour.
In 2004, the National Research Council of Canada created its highest honour, the Herzberg Medal, to bestow upon a scientist whose research contributions are characterized by both excellence and influence.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Helen Sawyer Hogg (1905-1993) A world expert in galaxy clusters and variable stars, she inspired many women to enter science and helped popularize astronomy in Canada Helen Sawyer was born in 1905 at Lowell, Massachusetts.
In 1922, she enrolled at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, and obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1926.
She then received her master’s degree in 1928 and her doctoral degree in 1931, both from Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
Her research topic was the study of variable starts in globular clusters, and she would work on this type of star for the rest of her life.
In 1930, she married Frank Hogg, a young Canadian and fellow astronomy student.
In 1931, they moved to Canada where Frank accepted a post at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
Unfortunately, the depression had hit and Helen was unable to find work.
She nonetheless obtained permission to use the observatory’s telescope and was able to pursue her study of globular masses on a volunteer basis.
In 1935, Helen and Frank relocated to Ontario where Frank took a professorship with the astronomy department at the University of Toronto.
Helen pursued her observations of globular clusters at the David Dunlap Observatory, and she was hired as a research officer in the astronomy department in 1936.
Two years later, in 1941, she started teaching at the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
In 1946, Helen’s husband Frank became Director of the David Dunlap Observatory, a position he would occupy until his death in 1951.
In 1957, Hogg became adjunct full professor in the astronomy department of the University of Toronto.
She continued her work on variable stars, which numbered more than 2,000 by the end of her career.
The parameters she measured during her research provided a basis for estimating the age of our galaxy and for improving our understanding of its evolution.
In 1970, Hogg hosted her own television show on astronomy.
In 1971, she founded the Astronomical Society of Canada and became its first president.
She retired in 1976, was named Professor Emeritus, and wrote a popular guide to astronomy titled The Stars Belong to Everyone.
Helen Sawyer Hogg died in Toronto at the age of 92.
She had received numerous distinctions for her work in astronomy and for her efforts to popularize the science, including the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 2917 was named in her honour.
In 1985, the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada and the Astronomical Society of Canada created the Helen Sawyer Hogg Public Lecture.
The lecture, given each year by an invited speaker during the annual meeting of the two societies, commemorates her contributions to public appreciation of the universe.
The Canadian National Museum of Science and Technology's observatory in Ottawa is named for her.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Andrew McKellar (1910-1960) Known around the world as one of Canada’s best astronomers, he was the first to measure the temperature of the Universe Andrew McKellar was born in 1910 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
In 1930, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and then enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where he obtained his master’s degree in 1932 and his doctoral degree in 1933.
He specialized in molecular spectroscopy; that is, in the detection and analysis of molecular structure.
In 1933, he became a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge.
It was there that he made his first forays into astronomy by studying the Sun.
In 1935, he accepted a position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia.
He began measuring the orbits of binary stars and pursued his own research into molecular spectroscopy.
World War II erupted in 1939 and McKellar became a research officer for the Royal Canadian Navy.
He attained the rank of lieutenant commander, all the while pursuing his astronomy work and publishing several significant scientific articles.
In 1940, he began using spectroscopy to determine the composition of comets and demonstrated that solar rays modify their spectra.
Also in 1940, he was the first to detect the presence of matter in interstellar space when he identified the spectrum of the organic compounds cyanogen ("CN") and methyne ("CH").
In 1978, with McKellar having passed away almost twenty years earlier, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Penzias and Wilson for their part in the discovery that launched the Big Bang hypothesis to the forefront of cosmological theories.
When World War II ended in 1945, McKellar reclaimed his position as researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria and remained there until his death in 1960.
In 1948, he was the first to provide proof of the existence of the carbon-nitrogen cycle ("CN cycle") within cold carbon stars.
The CN cycle, which had been predicted 10 years earlier, is a chain of thermonuclear reactions in which carbon and nitrogen combine to release enormous amounts of energy.
According to the theory, it is this energy that sustains cold carbon stars.
During the 1950’s, McKellar became increasingly interested in giant cold stars (those with surface temperatures as low as 2,000° C) and broadened our knowledge about their size and chemical composition.
Among other contributions, he demonstrated that large turbulent movements could agitate their atmospheres.
Succumbing to an incurable disease, he died in 1960 in Victoria, British Columbia, at the young age of 50.
He had completed a full day of work at the observatory just four days before he passed away.
McKellar received many awards for his work in astronomy, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
In 1962, the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria named their 1.2-metre telescope in his honour.
The telescope is used to measure the speed of stars and to determine their chemical compositions.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Arthur Edwin Covington (1913-2001) As Canada’s first radio astronomer, he collected data on solar activity every day for more than thirty years; his work constitutes the world’s best database in the field Arthur Edwin Covington was born in 1913 in Regina, Saskatchewan.
In 1938, he received his bachelor’s degree from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, and obtained his master’s degree from the same institution in 1940.
That same year, he enrolled at the University of California in Berkeley where, two years later in 1942, he received his doctoral degree in nuclear physics.
At that point, he moved to Ottawa, Ontario, and participated in the war effort by helping develop new radar systems at the National Research Council of Canada.
After the war, Covington proposed a research project that would convert surplus radar equipment into instruments that could study cosmic radiation.
His proposal was accepted in 1946 and he began constructing the first Canadian radio telescope.
Once the equipment had been calibrated, he decided to measure the radiation emanating from the Sun, or more specifically, it’s "radio flux": the variations in its energy output at radio wavelengths.
He began collecting data in July of 1946 and quickly realized that the flux changed from day to day.
Unable to determine whether these daily variations were related to problems with the instruments or to the presence of dark spots ("sunspots") found on the Sun’s surface, he decided to use a partial solar eclipse on November 23, 1946, to his advantage: he would monitor any variations in the radio flux as sunspots became covered by the Moon.
Much to his surprise, he determined that the dimmer regions of the Sun – those marked by sunspots – emit much stronger radiation than the more luminous unmarked areas.
He thus provided the first direct evidence that sunspots are associated with radiation "hot spots".
Encouraged by this discovery, Covington began collecting daily data on the Sun’s radio flux in 1947, and succeeded in demonstrating that the number of sunspots is related to the Sun’s radiation flux.
He collected data on a continuous basis from that point forward and his measurements were used around the world.
In 1951, he constructed a device that would detect the radiation emitted by specific regions on the Sun’s surface.
He thus managed to measure the brilliance of the Sun’s corona (the uppermost level of the Sun’s atmosphere) and the temperature of the regions above sunspots (about 1,500,000 °C).
His work would greatly contribute to our understanding of the underlying mechanisms that create sunspots.
Covington succeeded in demonstrating that the intensity of solar radiation is related to the magnetic activity of the Sun, which has crucial implications for numerous human activities, such as communications systems, power lines, climate predictions, agriculture, fishing, space exploration, manmade satellites, geophysics, etc.
In 1959, the Algonquin Radio Observatory was established in Ontario and Covington became its director.
He took his retirement in 1978 and died in 2001 in Kingston, Ontario, at 88 years old.
One of the buildings at the Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics in Penticton was named in his honour in 2003.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Anne Barbara Underhill (1920-2003) A pioneer in the field of hot blue stars, she perfected sophisticated calculation techniques to better understand their atmospheres Anne Barbara Underhill was born in 1920 in Vancouver, British Columbia.
She obtained her bachelor’s degree in 1942 and her master’s degree in 1944 from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1948, Underhill completed postdoctoral work at the Copenhagen Observatory in Denmark, and then joined the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, where she stayed until 1962.
Underhill specialized in the study of "early-type stars" or "OB stars"; that is, very hot blue stars.
Newly discovered and poorly understood at the time, these stars were surrounded by very thick atmospheres.
Underhill collected a lot of data on OB stars at Victoria but quickly realized that no existing mathematical model could interpret her data.
Not one to give up, Underhill took it upon herself to develop and perfect the mathematical equations required to model the atmospheres of OB stars.
She began in the 1950’s, an era in which the only available computers were mechanical devices that had to be manually operated; it was an arduous task due to the enormous amount of time required to complete each calculation.
In 1962, Underhill became a professor of stellar astrophysics at Utrecht University in the Netherlands where she pursued her work on OB stars.
In 1966, she wrote The Early Type Stars, a book that quickly became a standard reference for OB stars.
In 1970, Underhill became the director of the new optical astronomy laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Maryland.
She contributed to the development of the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite until 1977, at which point she returned to her work on OB stars.
It was in the 1970’s that Underhill became convinced that Wolf-Rayet type stars are young, not old (an idea that we now know to be incorrect), and she retained this conviction for the rest of her life.
Wolf-Rayet stars release colossal quantities of matter into space.
She retired in 1985 and returned to Canada as Professor Emeritus at the University of British Columbia in Victoria.
She died in Vancouver at the age of 83.
She received numerous awards for her work in astronomy and was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Sidney van den Bergh (1929- ) A world expert in galaxy classification and the measurement of cosmic distances, he made several estimates of the size and age of the Universe Sidney van den Berg was born in 1929 in Wassenaar, Netherlands.
He spent one year at the University of Leiden and then went to Princeton University in the United States on a scholarship.
He received his bachelor’s degree from Princeton in 1950, and his master’s from Ohio State University in 1952.
He finished his studies in 1956 with a doctoral degree from the University of Göttingen in Germany.
He was hired as a professor at Ohio State University the same year he graduated, and he stayed there until 1958 when he accepted a professorship at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto in Ontario.
He became involved in expanding the observatory’s facilities, perfecting computerized calculation techniques, and developing the field of polychrome photometry.
Van den Bergh’s main specialty was the study of meteors, but his interests quickly diversified and by 1960 he had already published numerous articles on globular clusters, interstellar clouds, galaxies and supernovae.
Four years later, he became President and Chairman of the Board of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation.
He retired in 1986, but retained a researcher position at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria.
Today, van den Bergh focuses his research on the classification and the evolution of galaxies using images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.
He retains an interest in a number of diverse subjects: among others, he published an article in 1992 that refuted the idea of an astronomical significance for the Nazca lines of Peru, and one in 1994 demonstrating that it is unlikely supernova explosions caused mass extinctions on Earth.
Van den Bergh has published more than 500 scientific articles.
He received numerous awards for his work and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 bears his name in his honour.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Hubert Reeves (1932- ) A specialist in the origin of light elements and a highly talented popularizer of astronomy, he is often called "the poet of the stars" Hubert Reeves was born in 1932 in Montreal, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in 1953, his master’s from McGill University in Montreal in 1955, and his doctoral degree from Cornell University in New York in 1960.
In 1965, he became the Director of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique ("National Science Research Centre") in Paris and a scientific consultant for the Commissariat à l’énergie atomique ("Nuclear Energy Commission") in Saclay, France.
A specialist in astrophysics, Reeves studies the thermonuclear reactions that occur in stars; that is, the reactions that create the chemical elements that make up matter.
Since 1962, his work has focused on nuclear reactions involving carbon and oxygen.
He also focuses part of his research on neutrinos, a type of subatomic particle that we still know very little about.
In 1967, he became increasingly interested in the origin of the light elements lithium, beryllium and boron.
The very high temperatures that occur inside stars would destroy these three elements, so they must form elsewhere, namely out in space.
In 1968, he published Stellar Evolution and Nucleosynthesis, and in 1972 he wrote Nuclear Reactions in Stellar Surfaces and their Relations with Stellar Evolution.
These were the only two publications, among his many books, that were written for specialists in the field.
In 1971, Reeves helped demonstrate, along with other colleagues, that a process known as "spallation" creates lithium, beryllium and boron.
During this process, the atomic nuclei of relatively heavy elements, like oxygen, "break" under the impact of cosmic rays (particles that travel at high speed through space).
Some of the "pieces" created by these collisions are lithium, beryllium or boron atoms.
In 1972, Reeves collaborated with Johannes Geiss to explain the origin of two other light elements: deuterium and helium-3.
The test for their hypothesis was made possible by experiments conducted during the Apollo moon missions, and the results also allowed them to estimate the density of normal matter in the Universe.
In 1977, Reeves published Soleil ("Sun"), his first popular science book.
Four years later, in 1981, he wrote another, Patience dans l’azur ("Patience in the Sky"), about the different steps in the formation of the Universe that gained immediate international acclaim.
Another 15 or so popular astronomy books were published in the years to follow, some with co-authors.
The beginning of the 1980’s marked a time of increasing popularity for Reeves as he gave many public lectures and appeared on television shows and in films, speaking not just on the topic of astronomy, but also the environment.
Reeves received many awards and distinctions for his work in astronomy and public communications.
In 2001, he and Johannes Geiss received the Einstein prize for their work on the density of the Universe.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers René Racine (1939- ) As an inventor of exceptional astronomical instruments, he played a key role in the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory René Racine was born in 1939 in Quebec City.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City in 1963, and went on to the University of Toronto where he received his master’s degree in 1965 and his doctoral degree in 1967.
He then obtained a research scholarship at the Carnegie Institute and spent the next two years (1967-1969) at the Mount Wilson and Palomar observatories near Pasadena, California.
Racine specializes in the study of globular clusters.
Globular clusters are collections of stars that form a spherical shape containing anywhere from 10,000 to millions of stars.
Racine studies them using photometry, a technique that measures the intensity of light emitted from an object, which can be used to extract information about its size, temperature, etc.
In 1969, he became a professor in the astronomy and astrophysics department of the University of Toronto.
Upon his arrival, Racine teamed up with colleagues Sidney van den Bergh and Robert F. Garrison to propose that the new observatory for the university be built at Las Campanas in Chile.
The 60-centimetre telescope saw first light in 1971, and Racine equipped it with a new photometer of his own design.
In 1976, he became astronomy professor for the physics department at the University of Montreal.
Racine played a key role in the creation of the new Mont-Mégantic Observatory and was its director from 1976 to 1980.
In 1980, he was named Executive Director of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFWT).
He worked on improving the image quality of the telescope and succeeded in producing the highest resolution images in the world, all the while pursuing his work in astronomical research.
In 1984, he left his post as Director of the CFWT and returned as Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
In 1997, he retired from his positions as Adjunct Full Professor and Director of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, and became Professor Emeritus at the University of Montreal.
Racine was elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada in 1989 and the Order of Canada in 1999.
In 2005, he was made an Officer of the Ordre national du Québec (National Order of Quebec).
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Barrie Hutchings (1941- ) He was the first to discover a black hole outside our galaxy John Barrie Hutchings was born in 1941 in Johannesburg, South Africa.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1962, his bachelor’s with Honours in 1963, and his master’s in 1964 from the Rand University of South Africa.
He then obtained his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England in 1967.
From 1967 to 1969, he took a position as a postdoctoral researcher at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victoria, British Columbia, and he remains there as a researcher to this day.
Hutchings specializes in the atmospheres of OB stars (very hot blue stars).
In 1968, he discovered that these stars, which have very thick atmospheres, generate hot stellar winds.
In 1983, after ten years of research on binary stars, he made a major discovery:
Hutchings, along with coworkers Anne Cowley and David Crampton, identified the first black hole located outside our galaxy.
Not even one year later, in 1984, he made a second remarkable discovery by proving, along with David Crampton and Bruce Campbell, that quasars are the centres of active galaxies.
Active galaxies are those with centres marked by enormous energy outputs.
Over the years, the study of quasars became one of Hutchings specialties.
In 1987, he became part of the FUSE satellite science team as Canada’s Project Scientist (FUSE stands for "Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer").
In 1994, Hutchings became Chairman of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
In 1997, thanks to a newly installed spectrograph on the HST, he and some of his collaborators were the first to observe plumes of matter emitted from the centres of active galaxies.
In 1998, he was named Canadian Principal Investigator for the proposed CUVIT space mission (Canadian UV Imaging Telescope).
In 2000, Hutchings became Canada’s Principal Investigator for ASTROSAT, a satellite launched by the Indian Space Research Organization to study galactic objects and distant extra-galactic objects.
Hutchings has published more than 400 scientific articles to date.
He received numerous distinctions for his work, including his election as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Charles Thomas Bolton (1943- ) He was the first to discover a black hole Charles Thomas Bolton was born in 1943 at Camp Forrest, a World War II military base in Tennessee, United States.
He received his bachelor’s degree in 1966 from the University of Illinois and his master’s (1968) and doctoral degrees (1970) from the University of Michigan.
From 1970 to 1972, he was a postdoctoral researcher at the David Dunlap Observatory of the University of Toronto astronomy department.
He also taught at the David Dunlap Observatory from 1970 to 1972, at Scarborough College from 1971 to 1972, and at Erindale College from 1972 to 1973.
He then became a professor in the astronomy department at the University of Toronto in 1973, and has remained there ever since.
In 1970, Bolton was the first to develop a computer model for stellar atmospheres that was able to generate large regions of the modeled spectrum with enough precision to allow comparison with the spectra from real stars.
In 1972, Bolton made a discovery in astronomy that was so important it guaranteed him a place in the history books: he was the first astronomer to present irrefutable evidence of the existence of a black hole.
The black hole in question was Cygnus X-1, which lies at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.
Bolton detected its presence by observing star HDE 226868 wobble as if it was orbiting around an invisible but massive companion.
His calculations demonstrated that the companion could be nothing less than a black hole.
A black hole is a celestial body that is so massive and dense that nothing can escape its gravitational pull (its attractive force), not even light.
The name arises from the fact that it cannot emit light and thus appears black, and it traps all that falls into it, like a hole in space.
In 1978, Bolton demonstrated that the nitrogen anomalies observed in the spectra of OBN stars are due to the transfer of material to a nearby neighbouring star.
OB stars are very hot blue stars with thick atmospheres.
OBN stars are a subclass of OB stars that are characterized by nitrogen anomalies in their spectra.
In 1981, he suggested that the ejections of material from Be-type stars – a subclass of B stars – are caused by non-radial pulsations (vibrations that shake Be stars in an irregular manner).
Bolton established a Canadian first in the 1990’s when he wrote a bylaw to regulate light pollution that was adopted by the town of Richmond Hill, Ontario, in 1994.
Bolton has received many awards for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jean-René Roy (1943- ) Astrophysicist and current Director of the Gemini Astronomical Observatory, which owns two of the biggest telescopes in the world Jean-René Roy was born in 1943 in Saint-Hyacinthe, Quebec.
He received his bachelor’s degree from the University of Montreal in Quebec in 1969 before moving to the University of Western Ontario in London where he obtained his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1971 and 1973.
In 1977, he organized a workshop on the causes of the Cretaceous-Tertiary mass extinction that marked the disappearance of the dinosaurs.
That same year, Roy became an astronomy professor in the physics department at Laval University in Quebec City and later contributed to the creation of the Mont-Mégantic Observatory, which was inaugurated in 1978.
In 1982, Roy published his first book, L’astronomie et son histoire ("Astronomy and its History").
That same year, he and his colleagues, Yvon Georgelin and Jacques Boulesteix, designed a new Fabry-Perot interferometer for the Mont-Mégantic Observatory.
Other instruments were to follow.
In 1997, he became a member of the board of directors for the Gemini Project, a proposal to construct the two largest telescopes in the world.
One of the telescopes would be located in the northern hemisphere (Hawaii) and the other in the southern hemisphere (Chile).
In 2000, he left Laval University to become the scientific director for the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii.
His current research interests are spiral galaxies, the processes of massive star formation, and the chemical enrichment in galaxies.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Peter Gordon Martin (1947- ) A specialist in the study of interstellar matter, he was involved in numerous international research projects Peter Gordon Martin was born in 1947 at Owen Sound in Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto in 1968 and his master’s degree in 1969.
Three years later, in 1972, he received his doctoral degree from the University of Cambridge in England, and then returned to the University of Toronto to take a post as professor.
He strives to understand its origin and its relationship to stars.
To do this, he analyzes and interprets data gathered by telescopes on Earth and in space, and integrates these data into theoretical computer simulations.
During the first 15 years of his career, Martin concentrated mainly on interstellar dust.
Subjected to the magnetic fields produced by various celestial objects, interstellar dust tends to align itself in space like a magnet.
Any light passing through these particles likewise become aligned (the light becomes "polarized"), and by studying this light, it becomes possible to extract information about the composition and shape of the interstellar grains.
In 1984, Martin became the first person from the astronomy department at the University of Toronto to become a member of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Not long after, in 1987, he became interested in the collisions affecting hydrogen molecules of interstellar gas clouds where stars are born.
His contributions in this field have repercussions for our understanding of how the first stars of the Universe came to be.
Martin used the Orion nebula as a case study in 1991 to examine the conditions within nebulas and other regions where interstellar matter is concentrated.
The results of these studies have improved our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in the Universe.
In 1995, he became a permanent member of the science committee that manages the Canadian Galactic Plane Survey, a project that aims to map a large portion (60 degrees) of our galaxial plane at several different wavelengths using a common resolution.
Martin uses the collected data to study the formation of massive stars and the evolution of interstellar dust, as well as its influence on the ecology of our galaxy.
In 1999, Martin was named Director of the University of Toronto’s David Dunlap Observatory.
He is currently involved in a number of international research projects, including the James Webb Space Telescope (the successor of the Hubble Space Telescope), the Herschel Space Observatory, the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the Planck space mission.
Martin received the Carlyle S. Beals Award in 1994 from the Astronomical Society of Canada in recognition of his research contributions.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Gilles Fontaine (1948- ) An asteroseismologist and world specialist in white dwarf stars Gilles Fontaine was born in 1948 at Lévis, near Quebec City.
In 1969, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from Laval University in Quebec City, and his doctoral degree in 1974 from the University of Rochester in the state of New York.
He then took a postdoctoral position at the University of Western Ontario in London, and in 1977 he became a professor at the University of Montreal.
Fontaine has specialized in the study of white dwarf stars since he first started his doctoral studies.
A white dwarf forms when a star depletes its nuclear fuel.
Asteroseismologists – scientist who study the vibrations of stars – can measure these changes in intensity with an instrument known as a photometer.
There is a great interest for studying stellar vibrations because they allow scientists to obtain information about the internal structure of a star, and thus about its size, mass and composition.
It is analogous to seismology, in which geophysicists study earthquakes as a means to probe the internal structure of the Earth.
In 1982, only one year after forming, the team used mathematical models to predict the existence of a new type of pulsating star: the DB-type white dwarf.
That same year, their prediction was confirmed by telescopic observations of a DB white dwarf.
It was a first in astrophysics because, up to that point, new star types were discovered before being theoretically predicted.
In 1987, Fontaine and his collaborators had the idea to determine the age of the Universe using white dwarfs.
Since white dwarfs are very old stars nearing the end of their life, to determine their age would effectively estimate the age of the galaxy and – in the bigger picture – that of the Universe.
In order to accomplish this goal, Fontaine designed numerical simulation models that weighted several parameters for a given star – such as mass, temperature and luminosity – and calculated the time that it would take for the white dwarf to cool.
In 1990, Fontaine published the first results within the framework of the Montréal-Cambridge-Tololo Project, which he helped develop.
The main goal of the project was the systematic exploration of white dwarfs in the southern hemisphere.
In 1996, Fontaine and his team once again theoretically predicted the existence of a new type of star, a B-type white subdwarf, and astronomers once again confirmed its existence, this time at the South African Astronomical Observatory in 1997.
In the years since, Fontaine and his collaborators have continued to predict other types of stars.
Fontaine received numerous distinctions for his work, including being elected as a member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Asteroid 4230 is named in his honour.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers John Richard Bond (1950- ) World expert in theoretical astrophysics and cosmology, he made Canada a leader in cosmology John Richard Bond was born in 1950 in Toronto.
In 1973, he obtained his bachelor’s degree from the University of Toronto and enrolled at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1974.
He became a member of the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research and helped establish the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
Bond specializes in the study of the structure of the Universe.
During the 1980’s, very few researchers believed that it would be possible to detect variations in the cosmic background radiation due to its incredibly old age of 14 billion years.
However, in 1991, the COBE satellite (COsmic Background Explorer) did indeed reveal slight variations.
Encouraged by these results, Bond continued to develop many sophisticated mathematical tools during the 1990’s in order to study these variations.
He published many significant articles that established new rigorous standards in various disciplines or created entirely new research domains.
Bond’s studies were so numerous between 1981 and 1997 that he was the most cited Canadian astronomer in specialized journals during that time (more than 3,000 citations).
In 1996, he was named Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics.
In 1998, the first Boomerang mission was launched above the Antarctic.
It consisted of a balloon that carried a 1.20-metre telescope (named Boomerang) to an altitude of 35 kilometres to avoid the terrestrial atmosphere that would interfere with its instruments.
In 2000, Bond and several colleagues used the Boomerang results to demonstrate that the Universe has a planar geometry and to confirm that it is expanding.
In 2001, Bond became director of research programs at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.
Today, he tries to understand the cause of the accelerated expansion of the Universe, which is to understand the very nature of dark energy that Einstein first introduced in his theories as "the cosmological constant".
It is proposed that dark energy is a repulsive force that counterbalances and may exceed the braking force of gravity; it is the force that attempts to push the expansion of the Universe to infinity.
According to Bond, it is possible that some small trace – some evidence – of the existence of dark energy could be found in the cosmic background radiation.
Bond received (and continues to receive) numerous national and international awards for his work, including being elected as a member to the Royal Society of Canada.

Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Scott Duncan Tremaine (1950- ) As a world expert in cosmic dynamics, he made several predictions that were subsequently confirmed by observation Scott Duncan Tremaine was born in 1950 in Toronto.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree from McMaster’s University in 1971, and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1973 and 1975 respectively from the University of Princeton in the United States.
Upon obtaining his doctoral degree, he was hired as a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He stayed for two years and then moved to England in 1977 to become a research agent in the Institute of Astronomy at the University of Cambridge.
One year later, he returned to the United States to be a researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University in New Jersey.
Tremaine is an expert in cosmic dynamics; that is, the study of the effects of forces that move celestial objects.
In simple terms, he is trying to determine the changes in speeds and directions that affect various bodies.
He has applied this type of study to planetary rings, comets, planets, black holes, galaxies and galaxy clusters.
In 1979, he and Peter Goldreich predicted that the rings of Uranus (discovered in 1977) are kept in place by small moons that have not yet been detected.
The proposal met with scepticism from many astronomers, until the Voyager 2 spacecraft flew past the planet in 1986 and confirmed the prediction.
It was quite a triumph.
Thanks to his energy, the institute eventually carved itself an enviable position in the international scene.
In 1987, Tremaine wrote the book Galactic Dynamics with James Binney, which quickly became a reference work in the field.
In 1988, he and other collaborators demonstrated that comets with short periods (comets that visit us every 200 years or less) originate in the Kuiper belt and not the Oort cloud.
This revelation proved to be another high point in his career.
In 1991, Tremaine and Michel Fich determined the mass of our galaxy, the Milky Way, by using information about satellite galaxies (those that orbit our own).
In 1996, he left his position as Director of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics to head the Cosmology and Gravity Program at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Studies.
One year later, in 1997, he left the University of Toronto to become a professor at Princeton University in the United States where he remains today.
Tremaine has received many awards, including being elected as member of the Royal Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jaymie Mark Matthews (1958- ) Asteroseismologist, outstanding popularizer of astronomy, and mission scientist for MOST: the first Canadian space telescope Jaymie Mark Matthews was born in 1958 in Chatham, Ontario.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in 1979 from the University of Toronto and his master’s and doctoral degrees in 1982 and 1987 from the University of Western Ontario in London.
In 1988, he undertook postdoctoral research at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver.
In 1991, he was hired as a research agent at the University of Montreal.
He then became a professor at the University of British Columbia.
Matthews is an asteroseismologist; that is, he specializes in the study of the vibrations (pulsations) that shake stars.
All stars, like the Sun, vibrate at some time during their lifespan.
The study of such vibrations holds great interest for researchers as it provides information on the internal structure of a star, and thus on its size, mass, composition and even age.
In addition to asteroseismology, Matthews has other interests.
In 1987, he began studying Wolf-Rayet stars, which are stars that liberate colossal amounts of matter into space.
In 1992, he tackled the job of mapping solar spots on stars using Doppler imaging.
In 1994, he used open star clusters and groups of open star clusters to calibrate a scale for cosmological distances.
The year 1997 was a particularly significant year for Matthews.
In 2003, after six years of preparation, the MOST satellite was launched.
The satellite is the size and shape of a large suitcase, and is equipped with an ultra sensitive telescope that measures only 15 centimetres across.
Despite its small size, it is ten times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope in detecting tiny variations in the luminosity of stars caused by pulsations that shake their surface.
Since 2004, the discoveries made by Matthews and the MOST satellite regularly make the headlines in the media around the world.
In addition to his research activities, Matthews is constantly involved in all sorts of activities related to popularizing science: newspaper interviews, radio and television appearances, public conferences, telescope tours, supervising students in high school, evening courses, summer camps, work sponsorships, etc.
Particularly popular with young people, he received awards for excellence in teaching in 1999 and 2002.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Jack Newton (1942- ) Known for his world famous photographs Jack Newton was born in 1942 in Winnipeg, Manitoba.
He obtained a diploma in business administration during the 1970’s from Red River Community College and became manager for the stores Sears and Marks & Spencer.
His interest in astronomy began in 1954 at the age of 12.
Four years later, in 1958, he joined the Winnipeg Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
In 1969, he constructed a 32-centimetre telescope and installed it under a dome in his backyard.
He then started up an astrophotography section with the Winnipeg Centre and became the president from 1970 to 1972.
In 1973, Newton’s work required him to move to Toronto.
He began to test different film types for his photography work and one year later, in 1974, he published Astro Photography:
In 1975, he was elected president of the Toronto Centre of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Still passionate about photography, he published An Introduction to CCD Astronomy and Deep Sky Objects:
A Photographic Guide for the Amateur in 1977.
In 1979, Newton moved again for work-related reasons, this time to Victoria in British Columbia.
He continued to pursue his astrophotography activities and became the president of the Victoria Centre from 1980 to 1981.
He wrote two books with Philip Teece:
Cambridge Deep-Sky Album in 1983, and The Guide to Amateur Astronomy in 1988.
From 1990 to 1991, he again became president of the Victoria Centre and, in 1995, he and Philip Teece wrote a second edition to their book The Guide to Amateur Astronomy.
In 1997, he joined forces with Terence Dickinson and published Splendors of the Universe:
Throughout his career as an amateur astronomer, Newton regularly contributed to the magazines Astronomy, Sky & Telescope and SkyNews, and his photographs could be found in many popular media magazines like Newsweek and Canadian Geographic, or in books like The Audubon Society Field Guide to the Night Sky.
One of his more ambitious trips was in 1986 when he headed a contingent of more than 300 people to see Halley’s comet over Peruvian skies!
Newton received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal in 1977, the Ken Chilton Prize from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1978, the Amateur Achievement Award from the Astronomical Society of the Pacific in 1988, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada in 1989.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Damien Lemay (1943- ) An extraordinary amateur observer, he works at all levels to popularize amateur astronomy in Canada Damien Lemay was born in 1943 at Saint-Édouard de Lotbinière in Quebec.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in physics in 1966 from Laval University in Quebec, and became a telecommunications engineer for Québec-Téléphone (now TELUS-Québec).
Lemay made his first forays into astronomy around 1954 at the age of 11.
In 1962, he bought his first telescope, a 11.4-centimetre Tasco reflector that he still has today.
From 1971 to 1972, he used 7x50 binoculars to observe all the stars in the Norton Star Atlas, from the North Pole to -35° South.
In 1973, he took his first long-exposure photos during a guided tour over the night of May 26.
Astrophotography quickly became one of Lemay’s passions and he equipped himself, by the end of that same year, with a 20.3-centimetre Schmidt Cassegrain telescope.
Lemay was probably the first North American observer to see Nova Cygni in the sky in 1975.
A nova is a star that absorbs matter from a neighbouring star, which causes the new host to heat up and suddenly brighten.
It is a rare and spectacular event.
In 1977, he became the French editor of the National Newsletter of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada; he would keep this position until 1989.
In 1978, Lemay began the daunting task of assembling a photographic atlas of the sky using his 14-centimetre Schmidt camera.
He completed the work in 1985 after taking 1,182 photographs.
In 1981, he founded the Astronomy Club of Rimouski in Quebec.
The club was very active and they twice organized the annual conference of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1990 and 1997.
In 1983, Lemay initiated the first joint meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada, the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec, and the American Association of Variable Star Observers.
The conference took place in Quebec City, and with over 200 participants it was deemed an unequivocal success.
From 1990 to 1992, he was the National President of the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
From 1992 to 2000, he was Codirector, with R. Hawkes, of the Canadian Fireball Reporting Centre.
The centre operates from Mount Allison University in New Brunswick, and collects statistical data about falling stars that appear over Canadian skies.
The primary goal is to help recover meteorites in the short and long term.
In 2001, the centre moved to the University of Calgary where it falls under the responsibility of Alan Hildebrand.
In 1996, he was one of the founding members of the virtual group ASTRO & CCD of the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec.
The group works solely through the Internet and its members share their digital photos with each other.
From 1997 to 2000, he was Chairman of the Meteorite and Impacts Advisory Committee of the Canadian Space Agency.
Throughout his years as an amateur astronomer, Lemay has helped newcomers in choosing equipment and learning how to observe the sky, and he gives dozens of lectures and presentations each year at schools, scout camps, parks, etc.
He received several provincial and national distinctions in honour of his contributions in astronomy, including the Trophée Méritas ("Méritas Trophy") from the Amateur Astronomy Federation of Quebec in 1982, and the Chant Medal from the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada.
Astronomers « Return to the astronomers Paul Boltwood (1943- ) Renowned for his attention to detail, he took the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment Paul Boltwood was born in 1943 at Vancouver, British Columbia.
He obtained his bachelor’s degree in mathematics in 1966 from the University of British Columbia in Victoria, and went on to occupy various jobs before becoming President of his own company, Boltwood Systems Corporation, in 1980.
He became interested in astronomy around 1955 and constructed his first telescope around 1958.
After training himself in many techniques, he had completed everything by 1992.
In 1993, he constructed his first telescope with the intent of selling it.
Boltwood also began his own survey of blazars OJ 287 and 3C 66A.
Blazars are galaxies that are tilted such that the jets of radiation emanating from their core are aimed straight at Earth.
The observations and data that he gathered with his amateur equipment were of such good quality that he was able to collaborate with professional astronomers.
In 1997, Boltwood produced fantastic footage of the Hyakutake comet nucleus using his own equipment.
Boltwood was deemed to have taken the best image of the deep sky ever obtained using amateur equipment.
Using his 40-centimetre telescope (that he built himself), his CCD camera, an exposure time of 20 hours in his backyard near Ottawa, and digital processing of the image using software that he developed, Boltwood attained a magnitude of 24.1, even better than the Mount Palomar telescope!
He even managed to improve the image later to a magnitude of 24.5.

He is currently writing his doctoral degree at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, still on the subject of English literature.
Levy’s interest in astronomy began during a partial eclipse of the Sun in 1959 at the age of 11.
In 1965, he began to search for novae and comets in the sky.
By the end of the 1980’s, he was the most prolific observer in the American Association of Variable Star Observers with more than 10,000 observations per year for meteors, variable stars and Messier objects.
Always looking for a better climate and a darker sky, he moved to Arizona in 1980 where he still lives today.
In 1984, after 19 years of fruitless searching, he discovered his first comet.
Today, he is the discoverer or co-discoverer of 21 comets and more than 225 asteroids, including the famous Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet that crashed into Jupiter in 1994.
Author or editor of more than thirty books, numerous articles and more than 1,000 lectures and interviews, Levy is also involved with a number of magazines: he is Science Editor of Parade (USA), Associate Editor of Sky & Telescope (USA), and a regular contributor to SkyNews (Canada).
Over the years, he has developed numerous educational programs in astronomy for young people and the general public.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments The human eye An extraordinary organ The eye is the organ that allows us to see.
Light enters through the cornea and is projected onto the retina, which consists of cells that are sensitive to electromagnetic radiation.
From there, the light signals are converted into electrical impulses that are transmitted to the brain along the optic nerve.
Once the brain has received the pulses, it transforms the information into an image.
The human eye is spherical and its internal parts are transparent so that the maximum amount of light can reach the retina.
The cornea surrounds and protects the eye.
It is made of transparent gel-like material that helps converge light rays onto the retina.
The role of the iris is to control the quantity of light that passes through the cornea, keeping it at a fairly constant level.
Too much light can damage the retina, whereas not enough will prevent a person from seeing properly.
Its centre, the pupil, allows just the right amount of light to pass through so that we can see.
This is why the pupil contracts when there is too much light (like when the Sun blinds us) to prevent excess light rays from reaching the retina, and contracts when there is not enough light (like when we walk into a darkened room) to allow in the most light possible.
Immediately behind the iris is the lens.
It is a true lens in that it converges light rays passing through the eye onto the retina.
The lens of the eye is also flexible and can deform itself to improve the convergence of light.
On the other hand, they are not very sensitive to light rays and need a lot of light to work.
The rods are very sensitive to light and enable us to see when it is dark.
They are not, however, capable of distinguishing different colours and details, and this causes the poor colour contrast between objects that we observe when the lighting is dim.
In all, hundreds of millions of cells must work together in our eyes and brain in order for us to see.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments The first instruments The transit and the sextant
Many different astronomical instruments have been used throughout the ages.
Two stand out as having played particularly important historical roles: the transit and the sextant.
Such diverse fields as stellar cartography (mapping), navigation and the determination of time have all progressed significantly thanks to these instruments.
The transit is used to measure the precise moment that a celestial object passes through its highest point in the sky (also know as the meridian).
Used since ancient Egyptian time, the modern form of this instrument consists of a telescope that only moves vertically.
A dial on one side, graduated from 0 to 90 degrees, is used to measure the inclination of the telescope.
When the celestial object in question passes through the meridian, the observer notes its angle above the horizon at the precise moment of its passing.
These two measurements provide the coordinates (the position) of the object in the celestial sphere.
A map of the sky can be thus be assembled bit by bit and used to create tables that give the positions of stars, planets, the Moon and so on for the purposes of navigation or determining the exact time.
The sextant is an instrument that can be used to determine the angle between a celestial object and the horizon.
Used in conjunction with the transit tables, it is a simple matter to calculate the latitude of one’s position.
The predecessors of the sextant included the astrolab and the octant, both of which operated on the same principle.
The modern version of the sextant was independently invented in the 1730’s by John Hadley in England and Thomas Godfrey in the United States.

Astronomers « Return to the instruments Refracting telescopes Concentrating light by refraction through lenses The Assyrians (people who lived in a region that is known today as Iraq) were perhaps the first to have used lenses to magnify objects, possibly around 1,500 BC.
The evidence is a rock crystal discovered by the English archaeologist John Layard in 1850 during the excavation of the ancient city of Nimrud.
The crystal was cut and polished into the shape of a lens, however it is not entirely certain that it was used as a magnifying lens and not as jewellery or for some other purpose.
Evidence that lenses were in use during the first century BC can be found in the records of the Roman authors Pliny and Senecio who reported that an engraver at Pompeii used a lens to help him in his work.
Other historical evidence reveals that the Arabs were using lenses by the year 600 AD, as were the Vikings around the year 900.
It is difficult to determine when a refracting telescope was first assembled using lenses.
The first person to do so with certainty, and thus the person to be credited with its invention, was the English mathematician Leonard Digges who constructed a refracting telescope sometime between 1540 and 1553 to assist with his topographic surveys.
Leonard Digges – or perhaps his son, the English astronomer Thomas Digges – was also the first to turn a refractor towards the sky to study celestial objects.
The instrument did not become widely known to the public until 1608 when Hans Lippershey (or Lipperhey), a Dutch optician of German origin, began to make and sell telescopes.
Lippershey applied for a patent for what he claimed was his own invention, but was refused on the grounds that the device was already in existence.
The English mathematician Thomas Harriot was the first to study the Moon in detail using an astronomical telescope in 1609, and it is known with certainty that this occurred several months before Galileo Galilei, the famous Italian physicist, did the same.
Galilei, however, was the first to have published his observations in a book entitled "The Starry Messenger" (translated from Latin).
His book revolutionized our concept of the Universe.
The first refracting telescopes consisted of two lenses separated by some distance within a closed tube.
The larger of the two is the objective, or primary lens, and the second is the ocular.
The role of the lenses is to concentrate light rays into a single point – the focal point – so as to obtain a sharper magnified image.
It is the glass of the lens that allows light to be concentrated.
This phenomenon is known as "refraction".
Lenses, to be effective in a telescope, must be shaped so that all the refracted light rays converge in a single point.
Unfortunately, we now know today that it is impossible to focus light from an object into a single point using only one lens.
There are several types of aberrations, the main ones being chromatic and spherical.
All types of aberration cause deformation of the image transmitted by the telescope.
Chromatic aberration occurs because light rays of different colours are not all bent by the same amount as they pass through a lens.
Consequently, it is impossible to concentrate the rays into a single point.
Chromatic aberration causes coloured fringes to appear around the image.
Spherical aberration is due to the shape of the lens.
A lens is nothing more than a piece of glass with each surface shaped like a portion of a sphere.
Unfortunately, a sphere is not the best shape for concentrating light rays into a single point, but is the easiest shape to make when grinding and polishing glass.
Spherical aberration causes images to be blurred.
These days, refracting telescopes are made using several lenses that are designed and put together in ways that minimize the problems caused by aberrations.
Video sequence Peter Gordon Martin explains what aberration is.
Video sequence Jaymie Mark Matthews explains what a reflector is.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Reflecting telescopes Concentrating light using mirrors In contrast to a refracting telescope, which uses lenses to enlarge images, reflecting telescopes (also known as reflectors) use mirrors to accomplish the same goal.
The advantages are numerous: manufacturing mirrors is simpler and less costly than lenses, there are less aberration-related problems, and the main mirror can be supported from below.
Today, the reflecting telescope is considered as one of the most powerful scientific instruments ever invented.
Sometime between 1540 and 1553, the English mathematician Leonard Digges constructed the first reflecting telescope using a mirror and a lens.
In 1576, his son Thomas, an astronomer, used it to defend the idea that the Universe is infinite, which was a revolutionary concept at the time.
Nevertheless, it would be another 100 years before the reflecting telescope was widely used.
In 1663, the Scottish mathematician and astronomer James Gregory published his book Optima Promota in which he included the design for a new type of compact reflecting telescope.
The English physicist Robert Hooke built the actual instrument several years later, only a short time before Isaac Newton developed his own telescope in 1668.
The principle behind Newton’s telescope was so simple that we still use it today.
It consists of two mirrors: the primary and the secondary.
The primary mirror has a parabolic shape and serves to collect light from the object of interest.
The secondary mirror, smaller than the primary, is flat and inclined in such a way as to reflect light from the primary mirror towards the ocular and the observer.
In 1672, the Catholic priest and French teacher Laurent Cassegrain invented a new type of reflecting telescope that he described in an unpublished manuscript.
The Cassegrain telescope consisted of a primary parabolic mirror, which collected light from the celestial object, and a secondary mirror, which faced the primary mirror and concentrated the reflected light towards the observer by directing it through a hole in the centre of the primary mirror.
The image could therefore be viewed from behind the telescope, and not from the side, as with Newton’s design.
The big advantage to the Cassegrain design is its compact size, which makes it portable.
Moreover, heavy instruments can be installed at its based.
Today, the Cassegrain reflector is the most commonly used type of telescope.
Video sequence John Barrie Hutchings explains what a refractor is.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Invisible light collectors Seeing the invisible Refracting and reflecting telescopes are used to collect and study visible light.
Although visible light provides valuable information, it only represents a tiny portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
To see the rest of the spectrum, which consists of invisible colours, researchers need to use collectors that are capable of detecting wavelengths that correspond to the type of light they wish to study.
For the infrared domain, the parabolic mirror of a reflecting telescope remains the ideal means by which to collect and concentrate the light rays.
Because the light being collected is invisible, the human observer is replaced by an infrared detector at the mirror’s focal point.
Its purpose is to measure the intensity of the infrared rays.
Unfortunately, the situation is considerably more complex for the mid- and far-infrared domains.
One of the complications for detecting infrared sources in space is that the reflecting telescope collects a lot of background infrared light from the atmosphere, from any human observers present in the room, and from the telescope itself.
In addition, atmospheric water vapour absorbs a large part of the infrared rays coming from space, which makes data collection difficult – or even impossible – at some wavelengths.
To overcome these problems, detectors are cooled to very low temperatures (sometimes down to -269 °C) and the telescopes are placed at the highest elevations possible where the air is drier.
Another solution is to put them directly into space, orbiting Earth.
The great interest for astronomers in observing the infrared light of the Universe is due to its powers of penetration.
Infrared waves are capable of passing through dust, allowing us to see regions that are otherwise impenetrable to visible light, such as the interiors of nebulas.
At longer wavelengths in the microwave domain, absorption by water is a persistent problem and the best solutions are to collect data from high elevations or satellites.
In order for light rays to be concentrated at the focal point of a reflecting telescope, the size of the irregularities in the curve of the parabolic collector must be smaller than the wavelength of the light being collected.
Consequently, it is not necessary to use a highly polished reflecting surface like a mirror for light with very long wavelengths, like microwaves; instead, a simple metal dish will suffice.
Microwaves are of immense interest to astronomers.
Cosmic background radiation – that amazing "first light" emitted when the Universe was only a few hundred thousand years old – exists mainly in the form of microwaves.
Radio waves, which have even longer and less energetic wavelengths than microwaves, are typically collected using large metal dishes.
Radio waves are produced by supernova remnants and by electrons passing through the magnetic fields of distant radio galaxies.
For light with wavelengths that are shorter than those of visible light, like ultraviolet rays, it is possible to use optical telescopes.
Unfortunately for astronomers (but fortunately for human beings), most ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone layer before reaching Earth’s surface.
It is therefore necessary to use satellites for ultraviolet studies.
Ultraviolet light is the most abundant type of energy generated by very hot stars.
Satellites must also be used to study X-rays and gamma rays, which have wavelengths that are even shorter and more energetic than those of ultraviolet rays.
These light rays are so energetic, however, that they can easily pass through mirrors; special collectors must be used to detect them.
Most X-rays are emitted by pockets of hot gases found between galaxies and near black holes.
Gamma rays are mainly found in the vicinity of supernova explosions.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photographic plates Memorizing light In the early days of astronomy, astronomers had to draw their observations on paper.
The method was, of course, imperfect and prone not only to errors in reproduction, but also to the unintentional omission of important details.
The invention of photography, which could accurately transfer images to paper, was quickly adopted as a convenient solution.
In fact, astronomers began using photography almost as soon as it was invented.
The principle behind photography is the use of light-sensitive chemicals, like silver salts.
These are dispersed in a gel to create a mixture known as emulsion.
Once the emulsion is exposed to light, the light-sensitive chemicals react and become opaque to varying degrees depending on the amount of exposure.
The result is a photographic image.
It was in 1793 that the French inventor Joseph Nicéphore Niépce first began thinking of a method to record light.
He started experimenting in 1814 and succeeded in setting images on paper in 1816.
In 1822, he made the first permanent photo by using a sheet of polished tin coated with a petroleum derivative called bitumen of Judea (a type of tar).
Unaware of the progress made by Niépce, the British scientist William Henry Fox Talbot began his own set of experiments in 1834 and recorded images on paper in 1835.
His process became known in 1839 and he obtained a patent in 1841.
The French inventor Hippolyte Bayard began his experiments before 1836, but it was only in 1839 that he is known, with certainty, to have successfully recorded an image.
His process was publicized in 1840, and of all the other methods developed before 1841, it was Bayard’s that produced the best and most detailed images.
In 1838, after continuing the work of his associate, Niépce, the French painter and inventor Louis Jacques Mandé Daguerre took an image of the Moon at the request of the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago.
Daguerre’s technique, which used copper plates coated with silver, was made known to the public in 1839 and the images were called "daguerreotypes".
It would become the most widely used method after 1840.
The German astronomer Johann Heinrich von Mädler came up with term "photography" in 1839 by combining "photo" (from the Greek word for light) and "graphy" (to write).
The word was quickly popularized by the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel, who is often mistakenly given credit for inventing the word.
In 1840, the American doctor and chemist John William Draper produced a daguerreotype of the Moon: the first astronomical photograph ever created in North America.
The French optician Noël Marie Paymal Lerebours photographed the Sun for the first time in 1842, but no details were visible.
In 1850, two Americans – astronomer William Cranch Bond and photographer John Adams Whipple – produced the first photograph of a star when they made a daguerreotype of Vega (also known as Alpha Lyrae).
Also in 1850, the English inventor Frederick Scott Archer came up with the wet collodion process.
Collodion is a viscous (thick) liquid that Archer used to coat glass plates.
By producing a photographic negative on glass rather than on paper, the resulting images were much sharper and could be made much larger, hence the great interest for astronomers.
Archer published his technique in 1851 and astronomers rapidly adopted the use of photographic plates.
In 1857, using this method, George Phillips Bond of the United States was the first to photograph a double star (Mizar and Alcor).
In 1879, the American inventor George Eastman (who would go on to found the Eastman-Kodak company in 1892) built a machine for coating photographic plates with emulsion that allowed photographs to be produced in great quantity.
During the first few decades of the 1900’s, the Eastman Company worked in collaboration with several astronomical observatories to develop emulsions that were increasingly sensitive to light.
The photographic plate thus became the imaging medium par excellence in the 20th century.
Astrophotography experienced its golden age between the 1960’s and 1980.
Thanks to colour filters, images produced from photographic plates could also be presented in colours, which greatly increased the public’s interest in astronomy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Filters Blocking some light to reveal more details In 1861, the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell created the first colour photograph.
He made the photo by first placing a black and white photographic plate behind a plate of red glass.
He then repeated the procedure with a green plate, and then blue.
He projected the three "negatives" on a screen using glass plates in the corresponding colours and thus obtained a colour image.
Today, we call Maxwell’s red, green and blue glass plates "filters".
A filter allows some colours to be blocked, which emphasizes the remaining colours that pass through.
By carefully choosing filters, it is possible to reveal details that would otherwise be difficult to see.
In 1878, Frederick Charles Luther Wratten of England founded one of the first companies to supply photographic material.
In 1909, he developed a system of number-coded colour filters that quickly became the standard in the photography industry.
The Eastman-Kodak Company bought Wratten’s company in 1912 and continued to use his filter system.
After acquiring Wratten’s company, Eastman-Kodak began to manufacture filters specifically designed for astronomy work.
The company continues to make them today and, surprisingly, still uses Wratten’s original numbering system.
The market is shared by other companies – like Lumicon, Meade and Orion – who also design filters for professional and amateur astronomers.
Some filters are designed to block out the artificial light of fluorescent and incandescent lighting; this serves to increase the contrast of many celestial objects.
Video sequence Marie-Maude de Denus-Baillargeon explains what an optic filter is.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Photometers Measuring the brightness of celestial objects A photometer is an instrument that measures and quantifies the brightness of a celestial body (a galaxy, star, comet or planet, for example).
The brightness depends on the luminosity of the object and on the distance that separates the object from the photometer, as well as the amount of matter between the two that can obscure the object.
A very luminous star could appear dim if it is far enough away or is partly obscured by gaseous clouds and interstellar dust.
A photometer has several applications in astronomy.
In the case of a star, for example, a photometer can be used to determine its temperature, its distance and even its age.
Photometers can also be used to determine if planets are orbiting about certain stars.
Let’s take a look at the case of temperature.
A hot star will emit a lot of light in the blue portion of the spectrum (relatively energetic wavelengths), whereas a cold star will mainly emit red light (less energetic wavelengths).
By using a photometer to measure the amount of light emitted at blue and red wavelengths (that is, the "colour" of the star), temperature can be estimated.
The brightness of a celestial object is a measure of its luminous flux: the amount of incoming light.
The luminous flux of a star is dependent on a combination of temperature, the size of its surface, and its distance from Earth.
If we know its temperature (by its colour) and its distance (by other methods), we can calculate its surface area and thus its size.
Astronomers can use photometers to precisely measure the amount of light emitted at specific wavelengths that correspond to the emission lines produced by heated chemical elements.
This information is used to establish the chemical composition of a star.
Many different methods have been developed for estimating the brightness of celestial bodies.
All the initial attempts, however, had a major drawback: the estimate had to be made visually and could vary greatly from one observer to another.
In 1836, the British astronomer John Frederick William Herschel changed all that.
Herschel invented a photometer ("astrometer" as he called it) that allowed the observer to visually compare the brightness of stars using a scale based on the reduced telescopic image of the Moon.
It was the first true photometer.
In 1839, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago proposed the design of a new photometer using photographic principles.
His goal was to eliminate the role played by the observer in determining the brightness of an object by rendering the technique completely objective.
In 1844, the French physicists Jean Bernard Léon Foucault and Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau conducted a series of experiments for Arago in which a photometer was coupled with a daguerreotype.
It took until 1885 for photographic plates to be systematically used in photometry.
It was in that year that the Dutch astronomer Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn began to measure the brightness of 454,875 stars from the Southern Hemisphere.
The technique typically used at the time to determine an object’s brightness consisted of measuring its diameter on a photographic plate.
The more intense the brightness, the more the plate would react and the greater the diameter of the image.
The problem with this method is that if the light is too intense, the emulsion becomes saturated and stops reacting.
In 1910, the American astronomer Charles Edward Pickering found a solution to the problem of saturation: he proposed to measure the amount of light passing through the object’s image on the plate, rather than its diameter.
Many improvements have been made to photographic photometers during the 20th century.
Some of the most notable include the addition of an adjustable iris around a star’s image (1934), the complete automation of the procedure (1969), and the addition of a laser to increase the precision of the data (1971).
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Infrared cameras Photographing the invisible using infrared light In 1800, the German astronomer William Herschel was the first to discover that light is not always visible to the naked eye.
During an optical experiment, Herschel passed sunlight through a prism to separate the white light into its coloured components.
Using a thermometer, he measured the temperature of each of the coloured rays and determined that the temperature increased from blue to red.
Pushing his experiment a little bit further, Herschel placed the thermometer beyond the red light rays where no light was visible.
To his great surprise, he measured a temperature even higher than that within any of the visible rays.
He proved, for the first time ever, that invisible light – the infrared – exists beyond the red portion of the light spectrum.
In 1856, the Scottish astronomer Charles Piazzi Smyth detected infrared light emanating from the Moon.
He conducted his observations at different elevations and realized that the best data had been collected at the highest elevations.
He was thus the first to understand that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some part of the infrared light coming from space.
Unfortunately, the composition of the collodion was not revealed and, for the next twenty years, all attempts to produce another infrared photograph failed.
The first publicly known infrared-sensitive chemical compound, dicyanine, was discovered in 1903.
One year later, the American physicist Robert Williams Wood recognized the possibility of improving the sensitivity of infrared photographic film using kryptocyanine emulsion, the chemical cousin of dicyanine.
He conducted experiments and, in 1910, became the first to publish photographs taken in the infrared (the photos were of scenery).
Knowing that the terrestrial atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared rays coming from space, astronomers (both amateurs and professionals) began to collect airborne data beginning in the 1930’s.
It was during one of these expeditions that the American Albert William Stevens used an infrared filter in 1932 to photograph a total eclipse of the Sun from an airplane at an altitude of 8,200 metres.
In 1933, an American, Auguste Piccard, used an infrared camera to photograph the Earth’s ozone layer from onboard the hot air balloon Century of Progress.In 1942, the Eastman Kodak Company patented the first infrared-sensitive film that could produce photos using "false colours".
Telescopes borne on rockets were first used to photograph the infrared sky in 1970.
The project, called Hi Star, was active until 1976 and managed to accumulate a total of 30 minutes of observation time.
In all, 2,363 infrared sources were detected.
The first infrared space observatory – IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) – was launched in 1983 and operated for 10 months.
It mapped more than 96% of the sky and discovered about 500,000 infrared sources.
The ability of infrared light to pass through dust allowed the centre of our galaxy, the Milky Way, to be revealed for the first time.
A few years later, in 2003, the Spitzer space telescope was launched.
Spitzer is the "Rolls-Royce" of infrared telescopes and is used to study specific astronomical targets.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments CCD cameras Recording higher quality images without photographic film or plates A digital camera records images using a photosensitive cell called a charge-couple device (CCD).
A CCD is a thin layer of silicon divided into a multitude of small squares known as "picture elements", usually referred to in the shortened form of "pixels".
Each pixel is separated from the next by thin insulators.
To take a photo, the CCD is exposed to light: the same principle as taking a photo using a photographic film or plate.
When light strikes a pixel, however, the silicon produces an electric charge, and the greater the amount of light, the greater the charge.
When the exposure is finished, the camera’s microprocessor reads the charge on the pixels, row by row, and transforms the information into a digital image.
Exposing a CCD for two minutes can therefore reveal more details than is possible during a one-hour exposure using a conventional photographic plate.
Other than photography, CCDs are used in photocopiers, facsimile (fax) machines, scanners and barcode readers.
In 1969, two researchers at Bell Laboratories – the Americans Willard Boyle and George Smith – designed the basic structure of a CCD and defined its operating principles.
Several months later, they developed the first video camera to function with a CCD.
In 1973, the American company Fairchild Imaging developed their first commercial CCD.
Consisting of 100 x 100 pixels, it was used in 1974 to produce the first astronomical photo ever taken by a digital camera.
It consisted of an image of the Moon captured using a 20-centimetre telescope.
In 1976, Fairchild Imaging sold the first commercial CCD camera: the Fairchild MV-101.
In 1979, CCD cameras made their way into professional astronomy.
In 1983, the use of CCD cameras became much more widespread among professional observatories.
For the first time ever, it was possible to study celestial objects thousands of time paler than anything recorded on even the most sensitive photographic plates, putting a whole new face on the Universe.
Today, digital cameras are an integral part of the standard equipment in a professional observatory.
The largest, MegaCam (mounted on the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in 2006) uses a mosaic of 40 CCDs for a total of 340 million pixels.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Spectrometers Pulling light apart to extract information A spectrometer is an instrument that measures the properties of light over a specific portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.
There are two types of spectrometers: spectroscopes and spectrographs.
A spectroscope transforms light into a spectrum using a prim that can be observed through a small telescope.
The positions of the lines reveal the chemical composition of the material in question.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea to combine a spectroscope with his telescope.
He studied the spectra of fifteen stars and published his results in 1863.
He was soon followed by the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, and the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, all of whom worked independently on the Sun, planets, Moon and stars.
Rutherfurd and Secchi were the first to classify stars into groups according to their spectral characteristics.
In 1864, Donati was the first to clearly observe the spectrum of a comet (Comet 1864b).
That same year, Huggins and Miller succeeded in using spectroscopy to demonstrate that nebulas are clouds of gas, not stars.
As a result of these spectacular discoveries, spectroscopes were the focus of much developmental work and were continuously improved during the 1900’s.
Today, they are entirely automated and controlled by a computer, and the measurement of spectral lines is done using a photodetector.
A spectrograph operates like a spectroscope except that the small telescope is replaced by a detector that can record the spectrum of the material being studied.
The first spectrographs used a photographic camera as a detector.
It was the first photograph of our Sun’s spectrum.
The experiment was repeated in 1843 by the American doctor and chemist John William Draper.
In 1863, Huggins and Miller photographed the spectra of the Sirius and Capella stars using a wet collodion plate.
They thus obtained the first spectrogram (that is, the first spectral image) of a star other than the Sun.
Absorption lines were not visible, however, and the spectrum appeared continuous.
It was several years later, in 1872, that John William Draper would be the first to record the absorption lines of a star, in this case Vega.
The world of astronomy was revolutionized and astronomers applied themselves to spectroscopy in great numbers.
Today, 90% of our knowledge about stars has been possible thanks to spectroscopy.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Polarimeters Determining the direction of light waves to better understand stars and planets In 1669, the Danish physicist Rasmus Bartholin was the first to publish an article on the splitting of light rays by Icelandic spar, a very pure form of the mineral calcite (calcium carbonate).
Without knowing it, he had discovered polarization – a very important property of light.
Unfortunately, without the benefit of a theory that could adequately explain the nature and behaviour of light, Bartholin was unable to deduce the origins of the phenomenon.
In 1678, the Danish physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens also observed the splitting of light by Icelandic spar calcite.
He presented an explanation in 1690 that was based on the presence of "ether" – a hypothetical substance that filled space – but it was quickly disputed.
Using this theory, physicists quickly understood that when a natural light source emits light, it generates a myriad of waves that oscillate in planes oriented in many different directions (see illustration).
Consequently, if we project light onto a screen pierced with numerous parallel slits, only the light waves with the same orientation as the slits will be able to pass through.
Only two years later, in 1811, the French astronomer Dominique François Jean Arago invented the polariscope, an instrument that can determine whether or not light is polarized.
Among other things, he discovered that lunar light is polarized.
The study of planet surfaces using polarimetry was significantly advanced by the French astronomer Bernard Ferdinand Lyot.
Working since 1920 at the Meudon Observatory near Paris, he submitted a doctoral thesis in 1929 on the polarization of light reflected from the surface of several planets.
Among his hypotheses was the suggestion that Mars experienced gigantic sandstorms – a prediction that would be confirmed by the Viking 1 probe in 1976.
Lyot died in 1952, but the astronomer Audouin-Charles Dollfus continued his worked at Meudon.
Dollfuss was the first to determine that the surface of Mars consists of iron oxides.
Today, Lyot and Dollfus are considered as the pioneers of planetary polarimetry.
In 1922, he revealed the polarized nature of the solar spectrum emitted by the Sun’s surface away from sunspots.
In 1946, the American astronomer Horace W. Babcock used polarimetry to identify, for the first time, a star other than the Sun that produces a magnetic field (the star was 78 Virginis).
In 1949, the American astronomers John Scoville Hall and William Albert Hiltner independently discovered that 1--3% of the light emitted by many stars is polarized.
In addition, a map of polarized light across the sky revealed large-scale structures of our galaxy.
At the time, the phenomenon and pattern of widespread polarization could not be explained.
The answer was not long in coming, however.
In 1950, the American astronomers Jesse Leonard Greenstein and Leverett Davis Jr. proposed that polarization of interstellar light is due to the presence of dust particles that are naturally aligned with the magnetic field of the galaxy.
The two researchers even developed models that used polarimetric data to detect interstellar magnetic fields produced by individual stars.
Today, polarimeters are used to detect magnetic fields and to study the atmosphere of the Sun and other stars, the surface and atmosphere of planets, the interstellar medium, and nebulas.
Astronomers « Return to the instruments Interferometers Combining light rays to increase telescopic resolution In 1801, the British physicist Thomas Young demonstrated that light propagates as waves, like waves on the surface of water.
For example, if the crests (or troughs) of two light waves are coincident, they combine together to create an amplified wave in what is known as constructive interference.
This is destructive interference.
Between these two extremes lie an infinite number of variations in which crests and troughs combine together to intensify or dim the light.
In 1867, the French physicist Armand Hippolyte Louis Fizeau proposed that the resolution of telescopes could be improved if the collected light signals were allowed to combine with each other via constructive interference.
Unfortunately, the technology of the day did not permit him to construct an instrument capable of combining light waves as they emerged from a telescope.
During the next sixty years, most studies in interferometry centred on the same type of work, such as measuring the diameter of a particular star, or determining the distance between the two suns in a double-star system.
In 1946, the British radio astronomer Martin Ryle, with the help of the physicist Derek D. Vonberg, constructed the first interferometer that could operate in the domain of radio waves.
This breakthrough allowed the two scientists to discover many new celestial objects.
In 1956, the British physicists and astronomers Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Quintin Twiss perfected their first interferometer using separate telescopes.
Operating in the visible light domain, their instrument was tested on several types of stars and the resolution of the images were unequalled by any other imaging method in existence.
The sharpness of the visible details in a normal image is limited by the diffraction of light waves as they pass through the telescope’s objective.
During the late 1960’s and early 1970’s, the arrival of more powerful computers made interferometry increasingly accessible to researchers.
In 1967, a group of nine Canadian researchers – led by the astronomer J. L. (Allen) Yen of the University of Toronto – jointly used the 46-metre radio telescope of the Algonquin Radio Observatory in Ontario, and the 26-metre radio telescope of the Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory in British Columbia, to simulate a giant radio telescope measuring 3,074 kilometres in diameter (the distance separating the two observatories).
It was the first successful long-distance interferometry experiment ever conducted.
In 1974, under the guidance of the American physicist (and future Nobel Laureate) Charles Hard Townes at the University Columbia in New York City, students Michael Allan Johnson, Albert L. Betz and Edmund Charles Sutton constructed the first infrared interferometer.
 That same year, the French astronomer Antoine Émile Henry Labeyrie developed the first interferometer that could operate in real time.
Prior to Labeyrie’s breakthrough, radiometric data was recorded on magnetic ribbon and sent to a laboratory to be processed.
Today, images with very high resolution are obtained using interferometers.
Local celestial objects have the greatest scientific potential and represent the best targets.
Laminar air currents can also be blown across the surface of the mirror to minimize turbulence.
The Earth’s atmosphere consists of layers of air at different temperatures that interact and cause large-scale movements of air masses (referred to as turbulence by scientists).
For astronomers, turbulence is detrimental to their work as it disrupts the trajectory of light rays.
This causes stars in the sky to twinkle and telescope images to be distorted.
A simple means to minimize the effects of this inconvenient phenomenon is to build astronomical observatories at high elevations so that the telescopes only peer through the upper levels of the terrestrial atmosphere.
The first research into resolving the problem of image distortion related to atmospheric turbulence was conducted in 1902 by the German physician Karl Strehl, who proposed a method of evaluating the image quality produced by optical systems.
In 1941, the Soviet mathematician Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov made several breakthroughs into the study of turbulence.
His work would later be integrated into atmospheric models used to correct distortions affecting astronomical images.
In 1953, the American astronomer Horace Welcome Babcock invented adaptive optics, a process that corrects image distortions caused by the terrestrial atmosphere.
The technique consists of taking a sample of the light received by the telescope and calculating its degree of distortion.
Deformable mirrors are then used to redirect the light rays and produce a corrected image.
The proposal was promising, but Babcock was not able to construct his system for technical reasons.
In 1957, the American physician Robert B. Leighton of the California Institute of Technology succeeded in reducing atmosphere-induced image distortions using the 1.5-metre telescope at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California.
His technique consisted of inclining the telescope’s secondary mirror several times per second.
In so doing, he managed to obtain the best images ever recorded of Jupiter and Saturn.
In that same year, the Soviet physicist Vladimir Pavlovich Linnik published an article in which he proposed that an artificial "guide star" could be created by pointing a laser at the sky and targeting its focal point in the upper atmosphere to agitate gas molecules.
If an adaptive optics system uses a natural "guide star", it must be bright enough compared to the celestial object of interest to provide adequate light for the telescope’s detector.
The guide star and the study object must also appear sufficiently close in the sky.
It is not always easy to find a star that fulfills these criteria, hence the idea of creating an artificial guide star.
In 1970, the American engineer W. Thomas Cathey and his collaborators were the first to experimentally demonstrate an adaptive optics system that operated in real time.
Three years later, in 1973, another American engineer, John W. Hardy, built the first adaptive optics system intended for astronomy.
Originally designed to detect Soviet military satellites, the system used a deformable mirror.
Astronomers took advantage of the technique and new adaptive optics systems began to appear.
In 1977, the American physicist Andrew Buffington developed the first system to use a segmented mirror.
Each of the six segments is controlled by a piston that could adjust the inclination.
In 1981, the American physicist Robert Q. Fugate and his team began to work on a system that would use a laser to generate a guide star – the idea originally proposed by Linnik in 1957.
The first tests were performed in 1983 and 1984.
Since then, several adaptive optics systems have been equipped with a laser that operates on this principle.
In 1991, the American army been declassifying their confidential work on adaptive optics.
Upon accessing the documents, the astronomy community realized that they had already designed and constructed more powerful and less costly systems than those of the military.
As of 2005, 18 observatories and 26 large telescopes are equipped with image correction systems.
These systems are now considered as standard equipment for big observatories

Astronomers Light: a form of energy For us, light is an extraordinary phenomenon that illuminates our world and makes it visible.
What would we do without it?
Since we first opened our eyes, humans have worshipped the Sun as a god of light and a source of life and security.
The emergence of rational thought brought with it a need to question the nature of this phenomenon.
So what exactly is light?
Light is a form of energy produced by matter.
To understand how light is created, we must first take a look at atoms, the building blocks of matter.
In the world of atomic particles, the adage holds true that opposites attract and thus the nucleus and electrons are mutually attracted to each other within the atom.
Although an electron cannot randomly occupy positions within an atom, it can nonetheless change its distance from the nucleus by changing its energy level.
To do this, its energy content must be modified to match the energy level of the new orbit that it will enter.
For example, to move from a distant orbit into a closer orbit, the electron must eliminate some of its energy.
The energy released is partly electrical in nature and – as with all negatively charged bodies – partly magnetic.
This excess energy is released by the electron in the form of an energy packet known as a "photon".
A photon is an energy particle that has no mass and moves at high speed.
When a moving photon interacts with matter, it does so as a wave, like a wave moving across the surface of water.
These waves are known as "electromagnetic waves" because they display both electrical and magnetic components.
In fact, a photon can be thought of as a "particle of light" and an electromagnetic wave as a "lightwave".

Astronomers White light: a mix of colours In 1665, Francesco Maria Grimaldi, an Italian Jesuit priest, conducted a simple experiment the results of which went on to occupy the minds of several generations of physicists, including Newton and Einstein.
To his great surprise, Grimaldi found that the beam of light illuminating the screen was larger than expected.
Strangest of all, however, was that the light was no longer white, but became two or three rays of different colours.
Without knowing it, Grimaldi had conducted the first experiment into the splitting of light.
He assigned the term "diffraction" to the phenomenon, a term that survives to this day.
Grimaldi later realized that diffraction is a phenomenon that does not only occur when light is projected through a slit; instead, it occurs each time light strikes the edges of any object.
Several scientists were interested in the effect but none could explain it.
The answer was not long in coming, however, and it was Isaac Newton himself who would provide the explanation.
In 1662, Newton began his own optical experiments.
One of his first projects was to construct a refracting telescope.
He polished lenses and attempted to improve the instrument by getting rid of the coloured fringes that would appear on the margins of his images (he did not succeed and decided instead to develop a mirror-based reflecting telescope).
In 1666, during one of his optical experiments, Newton passed sunlight through a prism and split the light beam into different colours, like what he observed along the edges of his optical lenses.
Others before him had conducted similar experiments, but Newton was the first to understand that white light consists of a mix of light rays, each with a different colour.
Newton also understood that white light can be separated into its components because each ray of colour is deviated by the glass of the prism by a different amount.
He realized, for example, that red light is consistently less deviated than violet light.
This ordered separation of coloured rays is known as the "spectrum".
The spectrum of white light consists of six basic colours arranged in a specific order: red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet.
Although Newton understood that a beam of light of a particular colour is always deviated by the same amount, he did not appear to understand why this is so.
More than a century would pass before another British scientist by the name of Thomas Young would provide part of the answer.

Astronomers …or the birth of spectroscopy In 1801, the physicist Thomas Young clearly demonstrated that light travels as a wave, much like the succession of crests and troughs along the surface of water.
One of Young’s most astonishing feats was that he succeeded in measuring the wavelengths of red and violet light; that is, the distance between two crests or troughs of successive waves.
His results revealed a wavelength of 7 thousandths of a millimetre for red light and 4 thousandths of a millimetre for violet.
Combining these measurements with the basic concepts of Newton’s work, he concluded that light with a longer wavelength is less deflected than light with a shorter wavelength.
During the same historic period, around 1802, the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston uncovered a surprising fact: the spectrum of sunlight is not continuous.
In fact, numerous black lines are superimposed on the colours of its spectrum.
Unfortunately, this revelation did not attract much attention and no ideas were advanced to explain their presence.
Several years later, in 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer noticed the same black lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he did not understand their significance, he nonetheless measured their positions and catalogued a total of 324.
In 1859, the German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen (who improved and popularized the burner that bears his name) devised an original analytical technique: he inserted mineral salts into the flame of his burner and observed the colours produced by the gas emitted.
He was thus able to determine whether a particular substance was present in a mineral by observing a colour that, according to him, characterized that substance.
Gustav Robert Kirchhoff, a German physician and friend of Bunsen, proposed the additional step of dispersing the light emitted by the gas by using a prism.
The two researchers thus made a major discovery: each chemical element generates a series of spectral rays that uniquely characterize the substance, much like a fingerprint identifies a person.
The invention of tTheir new analytical technique, spectroscopy, led to the discovery of many new chemical elements in the years ahead.
Kirchhoff was interested in the spectrum of sunlight and realized that Fraunhofer’s black lines corresponded exactly to the bright rays emitted by specific chemical elements.
He deduced that the white light produced by the hot surface of the Sun was in part absorbed by certain chemical elements present in its cooler atmosphere, which produces black lines in the spectrum.
Kirchhoff’s discoveries opened the doors to spectroscopic studies in astronomy.
To their great satisfaction, astronomers were now equipped with a method for determining the chemical composition of stars and nebulas, and even their temperature, distance, speed and age by measuring the intensity of the different spectral rays and applying basic principles of physics.
It was through spectroscopy that light allowed us to "touch the stars", something long believed impossible due to the great distances involved.
One problem remained unanswered for Kirchhoff: he could not explain how matter could emit or absorb light.
Other researchers would help resolve this enigma 50 years later.
Astronomers A map of visible and invisible light Our understanding of the nature of light took a giant leap forward in the second half of the 1800’s with the help of the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell.
Maxwell was interested in a multitude of scientific problems that included electricity and magnetism.
He first published articles on these subjects in 1855, then compiled his work in 1873 into a book entitled Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which is now considered a classic in the field of matter.
In 1863, Maxwell discovered that by manipulating equations for electricity and magnetism, it was possible to extract a value that corresponded to the speed of light.
Surprised by this result, he began to suspect that light, electricity and magnetism were one and the same.
To follow up on this idea, he developed new equations for electricity and magnetism and concluded that not only is light a wave – as demonstrated by Thomas Young more than 50 years earlier – but an electromagnetic wave.
The discovery that light possesses both electric and magnetic components proved to be of paramount importance.
Maxwell went on to reason that invisible electromagnetic waves exist beyond the visible and ultraviolet light spectra, but sadly he did not live long enough to test his idea.
Hertz labelled these new waves "radio waves", and their discovery was put to beneficial use in the development of the telegraph and the radio.
Today, the electromagnetic spectrum is known to extend far beyond the colours of the rainbow, as shown in the diagram below.
The portion of the electromagnetic spectrum that we can see with our eyes is tiny with respect to its full extent.
If the electromagnetic spectrum was a window 30 million kilometres long, we would only have to open it three centimetres to let in all the visible light.
The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous but scientists have divided it in an artificial manner for practical reasons.
The divisions were mainly established by the limitations of the various techniques used to detect wavelengths.
For example, the limits of the visible light range is defined by what our eyes can detect.
Although other electromagnetic waves – radio waves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma rays – represent "colours" that are invisible to us, they are nonetheless forms of light.

Astronomers When matter produces light All material, when hot, will emit light.
Everyday examples abound: the stove element in the kitchen, the metal filament in a lightbulb, and even the Sun.
By the end of the 1800’s, scientists were observing this phenomenon in their laboratories but could not explain it.
Despite this lack of understanding, they nonetheless knew how to separate the light emitted by a gas into a spectrum that was diagnostic of the chemical elements contained in the gas.
In 1859, the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff called this type of spectrum an "emission spectrum".
Many researchers attempted to explain how matter could generate an emission spectrum but without success.
It was only in 1900 that the German physicist Max Planck would provide part of the answer.
Planck noted that it was impossible to solve the problem using existing principles of physics and proceeded to develop a revolutionary theory that marked nothing less than the beginning of modern physics.
In his theory, Planck maintained that light could only be emitted as small packets of energy that he named "quanta" (later known as "photons").
This proposal ran contrary to all contemporary knowledge about light at that time.
In fact, light was considered to be a continuous form of energy that propagated as an electromagnetic wave and not – as Planck proposed – as a form of discontinous energy in the form of particles, like photons.
The debate finally came to a head – and to a resolution – when the German physicist Albert Einstein entered the scene in 1905.
Einstein not only supported Planck’s idea, he went one step further: he proposed that light behaved as a particle (a photon) but also retained its wave character and must therefore be considered as both a particle and a wave.
Furthermore, Einstein established that the energy of a photon is related to the wavelength of the radiation.
He concluded that waves with long wavelengths, like red light, transport small amounts of energy, whereas those with short wavelengths, like violet light, transport more energy.
In 1913, the Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr integrated the advances of Planck and Einstein into his new model of the atom to explain how matter could emit light in the form of particles.
According to Bohr, the atom consists of negatively charged electrons that orbit around a positively charged nucleus.
The model further specified that electrons orbit the nucleus at well defined distances from the nucleus.
An electron orbiting near the nucleus has relatively little energy because it is held in its orbital by the strong attractive force exerted by the nucleus.
Energy must be added to this electron for it to "jump" to a higher orbital, and the further away it jumps, the more energy it would need.
An electron in a starting position that is farther from the nucleus already has more energy because it must compensate for the great distance that separates it from the nucleus.
Less energy would thus be needed to make this electron jump to a higher level compared to an electron that started closer to the nucleus.
According to Bohr, when a material is heated, some of the electrons in orbitals near the nucleus will absorb enough energy to allow them to jump to new orbital levels at great distance from the nucleus.
The electrons, however, will eventually return to their original orbitals; when they do so, they must release enough energy so that their energy content again matches the energy level of the original orbital.
Given the basic principle that the atomic nucleus of each chemical element has a positive charge different from that of any other element, its electron orbitals must also have distinctive energy contents since the electrons must balance the charge of the nucleus.
The energy given off by an electron when dropping from a distant orbital to a closer orbital will thus be a photon with a characterisitc amount of energy and a corresponding wavelength in the emission spectrum.
If the atoms of a given element have a combination of possible orbital jumps that is different from the combinations possible for the atoms of other elements, then every element will display its own unique emission spectrum.
The following diagram shows the emission spectra for various elements.
Notice how the emission lines are diagnostic, much like a bar code or a fingerprint.
Emission spectra of hydrogen.
Emission spectra of iron.
In astronomy, this phenomenon is often observed when white light, no matter what its source (the surface of the Sun or another star, for example) passes through a thin cloud of gas or dust.
In this case, instead of seeing a continuous spectrum from red to violet, astronomers will observe a spectrum in which several rays of colour are missing and dark lines take their place.
It was around 1802 that the British chemist William Hyde Wollaston noticed for the first time that the spectrum from the Sun displays just this type of effect.
The solar spectrum is discontinuous with numerous dark lines occuring among the coloured bands.
At the time, Wollaston did not understand why this is so.
In 1814, the German optician Josef von Fraunhofer also noticed these same dark lines in the spectrum of sunlight.
Although he also failed to understand their significance, he nonetheless measured and documented the positions of 324 lines.
It was only in 1859 that the German physicist Gustav Robert Kirchhoff understood that Fraunhofer’s dark lines corresponded exactly to the bright lines emitted by certain known elements.
According to him, the dark lines represented specific chemical elements that are present within the Sun’s atmosphere but are absorbing certain spectral rays emitted by the Sun’s surface.
Kirchhoff named this type of spectrum an "absorption spectrum".
Unfortunately, he did not understand at the time how matter could absorb spectral rays.
In 1860, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati had the idea of attaching a spectroscope to his telescope.
He studied the spectrum of fifteen or so stars and published his results in 1863.
He was followed in 1862 by the amateur British astronomer William Huggins, the American astronomer Lewis Morris Rutherfurd, and the Italian astronomer Angelo Secchi, all of whom independantly worked on the Sun, the planets, the Moon and the stars.
These researchers began a scientific revolution by being the first to extract information from the light emitted by stars.
They were quickly followed by other astronomers, and the study of emission spectra became the main field of study in astronomy.
Despite considerable progress, the explanation of how light could be absorbed by matter still eluded the scientists of the time.
The Danish physicist Niels Henrik David Bohr finally provided the answer in 1913.
Bohr developed a new model of the atom consisting of negatively charged electrons that occupy specific orbitals around a positive nucleus.
According to Bohr, the farther the electron orbital is positioned from the nucleus, the higher its energy content in order to compensate for the great distance to the nucleus and its attractive force.
When a cool material is heated, some of the electrons will jump from low energy orbitals near the nucleus to more distant and higher energy orbitals.
To do this, each electron must increase its energy content to exactly match the energy level of the new orbital it will occupy.
Bohr proposed that electrons absorb this extra energy in the form of "energy packets" as described by Planck and Einstein.
The same type of phenomenon occurs in space when the light emitted from the surface of a star (like the Sun) shines through the cooler gases in the atmosphere surrounding it.
The atmosphere absorbs part of the white light emitted from the star, which produces a colour spectrum marked by dark lines (absorption lines) that are characteristic of the elements present in the gas.
The study of a star’s spectrum thus gives us information about the chemical composition of its atmosphere.
Astronomers The astronomer’s unit for measuring distance In astronomy, distances between celestial objects – like stars and galaxies – are very large.
For example, the distance that separates us from out closest neighbour, the Moon, is on average 385,000 kilometres.
The Sun, on the otherhand, is on average 150 million kilometres away, and the next closest star is Proxima Centauri at 40,000 billion kilometres.
To avoid manipulating such long numbers on a regular basis, a unit of distance better adapted to the scale of the Universe quickly became a necessity.
One unit of distance commonly used in astronomy is the light-year.
A light-year is the distance travelled by light in one year, which is 9 trillion, 460 billion, 730 million, 472 thousand and 581 kilometres.
It was first necessary to determine the speed of light in order to know the distance that it will travel in one year.
Before 1676, most scientists thought that light moved instantaneously from one point to another.
In that year, however, the Danish physicist Ole Christensen Rømer was the first to demonstrate that light had a finite speed.
In 1671, Rømer began to observe the satellites of Jupiter and decided to measure the time it took for one of the moons (particularly Io) to disappear behind the giant planet and reappear on the other side.
By accumulating data for many years, he determined that the time separating the eclipses was shorter when the Earth was closer to Jupiter and longer when it was at a greater distance.
In 1675, the French astronomer Jean-Dominique Cassini, for whom Rømer was an assistant, proposed that the difference was due to the time it took light to travel from Jupiter to Earth.
However, he quickly changed his mind and abandoned the hypothesis.
Rømer, on the other hand, continued to pursue the idea and estimated that light takes 22 minutes to travel a distance equal to the diameter of the Earth’s orbit (we know today that the true value is closer to 16 minutes and 40 seconds).
If Rømer had calculated the speed of light using his data, he would have come up with an answer of 135,000 kilometres per second, which is about half the accepted value today of 299,792 kilometres per second.
The main source of error would have been the diameter of Earth’s orbit, which was not well known at the time.
It was only in 1729 that the majority of the astronomical community were finally convinced that light had finite speed.
The British astronomer James Bradley published a study demonstrating that the annual variation observed in the position of the stars is related to the speed of light.
He estimated that light travels at 301,000 kilometres per second, which is very close to the accepted value.
In 1838, the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel (and not the Scottish astronomer Thomas Henderson, as is often mentioned) was the first to use the light-year as a unit of measurement in astronomy.
He measured the distance separating us from the binary star 61 Cygni as 10.3 light-years.
The advantage of the light-year as a unit of measurement is not only that it quantifies distance, but that it also provides the time it takes for light to reach Earth.
For example, if 61 Cygni is 10.3 light-years from Earth (97,445,523,867,584 kilometres), then it takes it’s light 10.3 years to reach us.
We are therefore always seeing 61 Cygni as it was more than 10 years ago.
This is how light allows us to "see into the past" and why a telescope is really a type of "time travel machine".
This concept applies equally to very distant galaxies that are measured at distances of 10 to 12 billion light-years: they appear to us now the way they existed 10 to 12 billion years ago, only a short time after the Big Bang.

Astronomers When stars disappear… One of the negative effects of industrialization on human activity and the environment is the production of excessive light.
It may seem strange, but excess light is a form of pollution, particularly at night.
The negative effects of light pollution impact many fields of study, including economics, ecology and, of course, astronomy.
Most people do not consider the surplus of artificial light as a form of pollution because it is not permanent; all we must do is collectively turn out our lights to make it disappear.
In reality, however, such a solution is unrealistic because our society needs artificial light to function.
Light pollution is mainly caused by lighting systems that are misdirected, excessive, inefficient or unnecessary.
Most light pollution is found in urban settings where artificial light sources are numerous.
In these areas, light sources may be partly directed towards the sky, or downward directed light may be reflected upward.
Light is then dispersed by layers in the atmosphere and produces a glow that diminishes the darkness of the night sky.
In large Canadian cities, more than 95% of stars that can normally be seen with the naked eye are no longer visible.
Unexpected negative effects From bacteria to the stars The negative effects of light pollution on human activity are numerous.
From an economic point of view, for example, the use of excessive lighting or unnecessary lighting constitutes a waste of energy that is costly to both the individual and to industries.
In Quebec, the cost of "lighting the sky" is estimated at 45 million dollars per year.
On a larger scale, excessive lighting can have an impact on global climate change if the required electricity was generated by burning fossil fuels.
Wildlife and plants are also affected.
For example, nighttime lighting can confuse animals that migrate (like moths and migratory birds), can modify predator-prey relationships, and can even alter competitiveness within the same species.
In the case of moths, for example, it was discovered that numerous flowering plants declined in numbers when the flight paths of pollinating moth species were affected by light pollution.
It is even possible for entire ecosystems to be affected.
In lakes, for example, zooplankton may stop feeding on algae if nighttime lighting is too strong.
This leads to oxygen depletion in the lake, and many species of invertebrates and fish then die by asphyxiation.
In astronomy, light pollution is a real and pressing problem.
It diminishes the contrast between the dark sky and celestial sources of light, which makes it harder to see the stars.
For the amateur astronomer, it is a major problem because access to a truly dark sky is increasingly difficult to find.
The increasing inaccessibility of the starry sky is unfortunate because it has become evident that amateur astronomy plays an important role in the development of scientific interest among young people.
In 2003, the British government even acknowledged the link between a reduced interest in the sciences and an increase in light pollution!
For professional astronomers, artificial light is undesirable because it interferes with the collection of data.
This is why new observatories are built in isolated regions.
A number of amateur astronomy associations are also involved in protecting our endangered legacy, the starry night sky.
The focus of light pollution abatement programs is to change the habits of the general population, companies and urban planners so that less artificial light will be wasted or misdirected.
The plans typically revolve around three lines of action.
The first consists of using lighting equipment that properly directs light where it is required, and not to the sides or towards the sky.
The third is to use an appropriate level of lighting and to only light when necessary.
Your turn to get involved!

Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Amerindians Stars were an integral part of their lives Before the arrival of Europeans, the Amerindians of Canada saw the starry sky as a place full of characters and stories.
Many of the peoples believed that everything found in nature was a living entity, even celestial objects like the Moon, the Sun and the stars.
In the Amerindian belief system, the Earth is flat and the celestial objects revolve around it.
The planets in the solar system are not thought of as planets, but rather as large stars that are simply brighter than the rest.
The Sun and other stars are seen as lights that move across a solid celestial canopy.
For the majority of Amerindian societies, each star is a spirit – a powerful and sacred being.
The Iroquois even oriented their long houses according to the four cardinal directions so that the Sun would shine onto the entrance at dawn, and set in the direction of the exit.
The Amerindians grouped many of the stars into constellations, and most of these are associated with stories that serve as a lesson to youngsters.
Some of the constellations, like Pleiades or the Great Bear, were also used to mark the seasons.
This is the case for one of the Mi’kmaq legends of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.
One spring day, Mother Bear woke up after hibernating through the winter.
Being very hungry, she immediately began to look for food.
Chickadee, who was also very hungry, decided to hunt Mother Bear.
Too little to hunt on his own, he got six of his friends to help.
After hunting all spring and all summer, the slowest and heaviest hunters beginning with the two owls flew lower and lower until they eventually lost the trail of Mother Bear.
Blue Jay and Pigeon were the next to abandon the chase.
Completely covered in blood, he shook himself near the trees of the forest, colouring them red.
That is why, since then, the leaves of the trees turn a vivid red colour in autumn.
As much as he tried, Robin was never able to remove all the blood that stained his chest, and he still wears his red marks today.
The three friends ate Mother Bear and left her skeleton there.
During the winter, the spirit of Mother Bear left the sky and came to rest within another sleeping bear.
The bear awoke the next spring and Chickadee and his friends hunted her too until they killed her in autumn.
The story has repeated itself every year since then.
This legend reveals how the change in position of the Great Bear constellation in the sky serves to mark the beginning of autumn.
The Amerindian societies in Canada used a lunar calendar of 10 months with 30 days in each month.
Amerindian legends Dreamlike celestial stories The North Star, which remains in a fixed position in the sky, was well known to Amerindian peoples.
The following legend describes its origin according to the Blackfoot of Alberta:
Two sisters sleeping outside woke before dawn and looked up at the sky.
One of them pointed towards the Morning Star (Venus) and said, "That star is so beautiful, I will take it as a husband."
Several days later, the same young woman came across a handsome stranger in the forest while she was carrying wood.
He was observing her, so she asked him, "What do you want from me?"
The young man replied, "I am Morning Star.
You wanted me as your husband, so here I am."
He placed a feather in her hair and asked her to close her eyes.
He flew her up to the sky, into Sky Country.
"You may use this tool to harvest vegetables in our garden, but you must never touch the sacred turnip.
If you do, it will bring misfortune."
Time passed by and the woman gave birth to a baby.
To her surprise, she found that she could see her tribe and old home through the hole left by the turnip.
Be careful, for he must not touch the ground for 14 days or he will return to me and become a star."
Unfortunately, what should not have happened did, and the child was forced to return to the Sky Country.
But as he tried to pass through the hole left by the sacred turnip, the child became stuck.
And that is why, to this day, there is a star that does not move across the sky.
In some cases, the same celestial constellation is the subject of legends in more than one Amerindian society.
For example, two tribes in Canada have stories about the constellation Pleiades.
This one is from the Iroquois of Ontario.
Many years ago, an Iroquois tribe began the trek toward their winter hunting grounds near a large lake in southeastern Canada.
Upon their arrival, tribe members hurried to set up camp and tackle their chores.
Eight children, tired of helping their parents, would gather together each day away from the tribe to dance for several hours.
He was covered from head to toe with a coat of shiny white feathers and said to them, "If you do not stop, misfortune will come your way."
The children did not listen and continued to take longer and longer breaks during which they never stopped dancing.
Day after day, the old man came to warn them until one evening, the children suddenly found themselves rising up into the air.
The old man shook his head and thought, "If only they would have listened to me."
Not long after, the people of the village saw the children floating high in the sky.
One of the children recognized his Father’s voice and stopped dancing, but quickly fell like a shooting star to the ground.
Seven brothers living alone in the Northern Plains passed their time looking for their parents.
Always on the move, they were looking for food and a new shelter to sleep in.
Tired of such a miserable life, the youngest among them, who was playing with a spider’s web, said, "Why not transform ourselves into something else?
"Don’t be stupid," another replied.
"Rocks can be broken."
"What about trees?
Trees don’t break – they bend with the wind," said one of the brothers.
"Even the greatest trees can be uprooted by wind and storms," argued another.
"Why not take on the form of Night?
Night is never destroyed!" exclaimed one of the brothers.
"Night is scared of light, and runs away when Day arrives," replied another.
"Then why not change into stars?" asked the wisest of the brothers.
"They live in the sky and never die."
The seven brothers thought that was the best idea.
The youngest helped each of his brothers climb into the sky using the spider’s web.
He put three of them to his left, and three to his right.
He then took his place in the middle, and there they remain to this day.
Astronomers The Amerindians The Inuit The Inuit Their knowledge of the stars helped them navigate in a hostile environment where reference points are few and far between The Inuit peoples living in the Canadian Far North can view the dark night sky continuously for long periods of time.
At the North Pole, for example, the Sun rises and sets only once each year.
Contrary to popular belief, however, the polar night does not last for six months each year; instead, it lasts for four and a half months.
The difference is due to the tilt of the Earth, which causes dawn and twilight to last for several weeks at the poles, thus shortening the duration of the true polar night by six weeks each year.
Nonetheless, four and a half months is still a remarkably long night, and one might think that the peoples of the Arctic would have built up an extensive astronomical knowledge base.
This, however, does not appear to have been the case.
The time during which the northern peoples have access to the starry night sky is actually much shorter than four and a half months, even for the Inuit who live closest to the North Pole.
Clouds and aurora borealis also mask the stars.
Finally, the intense nighttime cold makes observation physically difficult.
As such, the Inuit have only two and a half months per year to observe the starry sky if we take into account the presence of the Moon, and only two months per year if we take into account the other factors.
All in all, the peoples of the North have difficult conditions to deal with and only a short period of time for studying the stars.
The ancient Inuit believed the Earth (Nunarjuaq in the Inuktitut language) to be a flat and stationary body around which celestial objects revolved.
It occupied the centre of their universe.
The Moon (Taqqiq) was seen as a flat disk of ice, and the Sun (Siqniq) as a ball of fire.
The disappearance of the Sun below the horizon for several months was taken as a sign that the cold and frost of winter had weighed it down so much that it could no longer lift itself into the sky.
The planets of the solar system were seen as large stars, and the distant stars as holes in the celestial dome.
Interestingly, the existence of the North Star – the polar star that remains in a fixed position in the sky and around which all the other stars appear to revolve – appears to have been unknown to the peoples of the North.
Only 33 stars were familiar to the ancient Inuit and only six or seven of them were given names.
Among them were several that were used for navigation during their travels.
As for the other stars, they were grouped into 16 constellations, most of which were associated with myths in which humans and animals played central roles.
Four men were hunting a bear.
The bear escaped by climbing into the sky and the hunters decided to follow it.
As they climbed higher and higher, one of the Inuit lost a mitten and decided to return to Earth to fetch it.
The other hunters continued their hunt in the sky and we can still see them today climbing after the bear in single file.
The Inuit measure the passage of time by using the arrival of the full moon, and their lunar calendar thus has 13 months.
The year begins at different times for each Inuit society depending on their latitude, although the signal that marks the New Year is the same for each tribe: it is the moment when the Sun reappears above the horizon after the long polar night.
This, of course, explains why the timing varies according the tribe’s northern location.
One such story from the Inuit of the Canadian Central Arctic tells how light first appeared on Earth:
In the beginning, darkness was everywhere.
There was no light on Earth, and it was not possible to see the ground, the animals or humans.
Strangely enough, however, an animal could transform into a human, and a human into an animal.
There were several different animals, like bears, hares and foxes, but when these animals became human, they all became the same: they spoke the same language, lived in the same style of home, and hunted the same way.
It was during this time that magic words were created.
A word mentioned casually during a conversation could suddenly acquire magical powers, and nobody could explain how or why.
One day, a fox and a hare were having an argument.
The fox kept repeating "Darkness!" because he liked the way he could use the dark to steal the hunting catches of the humans.
The hare, on the other hand, kept repeating "Daylight!" because he needed light to help him find food.
Since then, night and day take turns shining over Earth, and the fox and the hare take turns finding food as well.
For the Inuit, the Sun is generally seen as a woman, and the Moon as a man.
A long time ago, after the World was created, a great shaman acquired such strong powers that he went to live in the sky.
The brother and sister lived in harmony for a long time until a great disagreement arose between them and the brother hit the sister, marking her face with a disfiguring burn.
The young woman left her brother to take refuge elsewhere in the sky where she became the Moon.
Since then, the brother and his fire have followed her, trying to reach her, but never succeeding.
The following is one example from the Inuit of Canada’s Eastern Arctic:
A powerful angakoq (shaman) decided to visit the Moon.
At his request, his hands were tied with a leather cord and the lamps in his home were extinguished.
The shaman then prayed to his tormaq (spirit guide) to transport him to the Moon, and the spirit complied.
Once he arrived, he realized that the Moon was a house.
He entered and saw a beautiful woman, the Sun, to his left who asked him to put out the lamp in front of her.
It is important that you do not laugh, or misfortune will come your way."
The couple began to dance before the shaman.
To his great surprise, he saw that the Sun-Woman had no back, no spine and no entrails; only a heart and lungs occupied her chest.
The dance was very strange and the faces made by the couple so peculiar that the shaman ran away lest he should laugh.
Soon after, the shaman decided to return to the house, determined not to laugh.
Once the dance had ended, the Moon-Man graciously welcomed him and invited him to visit his home.
In one room, the shaman saw large herds of deer that roamed over vast plains.
In another room, he saw many pods of seals swimming in the ocean.
The Moon-Man let the shaman choose one of each as a gift.
The shaman told them his story of what he had seen on the Moon.
The Moon-Man is often seen as a strong and fair spirit.
This legend from the Inuit of Labrador is one such example:
A young orphan lived with a family that treated him badly.
He slept in the entrance tunnel with the dogs and ate only leftovers.
Only the youngest of the Girls in the home treated him well.
One night, while he lay on the ground staring up at the Moon, he thought of ways to escape.
The more he stared at the Moon, the more convinced he became the he was staring at a human face.
He was so certain the face was real that he pleaded to the Moon-Man to help him escape.
The Moon-Man heard him and descended to Earth.
He took the young orphan with him onto the beach where he flogged him with a whip.
With each crack of the whip across his body, the boy became stronger and bigger.
In the morning, the boy returned to the house and struck down all those who had been cruel to him, with the exception of the kind young Girl.
She became his wife, and he became the leader of the village.
After all, it is only natural for humans to wonder how far our planet lies from the Moon, the Sun and other celestial bodies.
The ancients believed that this distance was not very far at all: they saw the stars as being fixed upon a nearby celestial dome.
Over the course of time, however, astronomers began to realize that the size of the Universe is much greater than anyone had ever imagined.
Today we know it is so big its limits remain unknown.
In the 3rd century B.C., the Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos calculated the Earth–Moon and Earth–Sun distances using the angle between the Moon and the Sun at the first quarter moon.
His method—based on imprecise data available at the time—estimated that the distance to the Sun is about 20 times the distance to the Moon.
Although we now know that the Sun is really about 400 times the distance to the Moon, Aristarchus’ estimate was nonetheless revolutionary because it suggested that the Sun was much more distant than previously believed.
Several decades later, another Greek astronomer, Hipparcus of Nicea, performed an amazing scientific feat by calculating the Earth–Moon distance with an error of less than 10%.
He did this using the time it takes for the Moon to pass through the shadow of the Earth during a lunar eclipse, and by applying his own ingenious geometric calculations.
Hipparcus also relied on the work of Eratosthenes of Cyrene who had fairly accurately estimated the diameter of the Earth to be 42,000 km (the real diameter is about 40,000 km).
Even more precise parallax measurements would have to wait until the development and improvement of astronomical instruments.
In fact, it was almost two millennia later in 1672 when Jean-Dominique Cassini, a French astronomer of Italian origin, and Jean Richer, a French astronomer, used more modern equipment to precisely measure the average Earth–Sun distance (also known as an "astronomical unit").
Their method relied on simultaneous observations of Mars from Paris and French Guyana.
The honour of being the first to measure the distance to a star other than the Sun must be given to the German astronomer Friedrich Bessel.
In 1838, he calculated the distance to 61 Cygni as 11 light-years from Earth.
These days, astronomers have several methods for measuring distances.
For objects within the Milky Way, most methods employ the method of parallax.
Another method for measuring galactic distances uses Type 1a supernovae: stars that generate constant amounts of energy after their supernova explosion.
They can be thought of as a "bomb standard": an explosion of known strength and luminosity.
Their apparent brightness in the sky is thus a measure of how far away they are from Earth.
Although these types of methods for measuring astronomical distances have allowed scientists to estimate the extent of the Universe, the sheer scale of it is mind-boggling.
It is somewhat easier to visualize such vast distances if we begin by imagining something smaller, like our own solar system.
The solar system consists of the Sun, planets that revolve around the Sun, and millions of smaller bodies.
The Oort Cloud, a vast reservoir of comets that circle the Sun, marks the outer limit of the solar system.
The distance to this boundary is about 1.6 light-years (recall that each light-year is almost 10,000 billion kilometres).
If you can imagine Pluto—the smallest and farthest of our solar system’s planets—as the same size as the head of a pin measuring 1 millimetre across, then the Sun would be as big as two 30-centimetre beach balls lying side by side 2.6 kilometres away from the head of the pin.
Our solar system lies in the Milky Way spiral galaxy.
At this scale, the size of our own solar system is quite insignificant.
In fact, if our entire 1.6-light-year solar system could sit on the head of a pin, the rest of our galaxy would be the size of a hockey rink!
The Milky Way is bunched together with more than 35 other galaxies to form a galaxy cluster known as the Local Group.
The largest member, the Andromeda galaxy, is visible in a moonless night sky without light pollution.
The other galaxies in the group, like the Large Magellanic Cloud and the Small Magellanic Cloud, are typically smaller than the Milky Way.
The Local Group occupies an area with a diameter of about 10 million light-years and a centre lying somewhere between the Milky Way and Andromeda.
If you can once again imagine the solar system as a head of a pin and our galaxy as a hockey rink, then the entire Local Group would measure 6.25 kilometres across.
The giant Virgo galaxy cluster marks the centre of the Local Supercluster at a distance of 50 million light-years.
The Virgo Cluster contains a "cannibal" galaxy at its centre—M87—that draws in and absorbs neighbouring galaxies.
Galaxy superclusters appear to be grouped together along long filaments that stretch out for hundreds of millions of light-years.
They are separated by immense voids that contain very few galaxies.
The size of these virtually empty spaces is truly incredible—on the order of 100 million light-years.
This grand-scale pattern defines the Universe across a distance of about 13 billion light-years.
As much as we try, we cannot directly observe what lies beyond that distance.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter Time The Universe existed in a highly compressed state more than 13 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since For a long time, scientists thought that the Universe was immutable—that it was unchanging over time and stars were the very essence of eternity.
It was only during the 20th century that scientists realized that this belief is false, and that the cosmos changes even on human time scales.
In other words, the Universe did not always display the same structure it does today.
It evolved over time, and thus it has a history.
This fascinating history began just over 13 billion years ago with a great explosion known as the Big Bang.
The Big Bang theory was first presented in 1927 by the Belgian astronomer and priest George Henri Lemaître.
Using Einstein’s theory of relativity combined with astronomical observations, Lemaître demonstrated that the Universe is expanding.
Although the Big Bang theory was not well received by Einstein and his colleagues, it is now widely accepted in scientific circles.
The turning point came in 1929 when American astronomer Edwin Powell Hubble published a short article in which he demonstrated that galaxies are moving away from each other: it was an idea that supported the expanding Universe theory of Lemaître.
Another source of support for Lemaître’s theory came almost 20 years later in 1948 when an American physicist of Ukrainian origin, George Gamow, began to publish alone, and then with colleagues, a series of articles describing the events that took place during the first few moments after the Big Bang explosion.
According to Gamow, the Universe was like an extremely hot "energy soup" that rapidly cooled enough to allow the first atomic nuclei of hydrogen and helium to form.
Gamow’s work thus explained the long-standing mystery of why the Universe contains 99% hydrogen and helium.
Gamow and his colleagues proposed that a glow permeated the early Universe when those first atoms were created, and that even today—13 billion years later—we should be able to detect this residual glow as radio waves from across the Universe.
The world of astronomy was in for a remarkable revelation in 1965 when American physicists Arno Allan Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson somewhat serendipitously detected a weak radio signal coming from all directions of the cosmos at once: the famous cosmic background radiation predicted by Gamow.
Penzias and Wilson went on to receive the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics for their discovery that helped prove the Big Bang theory.
The dramatic early moments of the Universe can be summed up as follows:
In the beginning, the Universe we observe today was concentrated into a single minuscule point.
It was only once it exploded simultaneously in all directions during a tiny fraction of a second that space was created and time began to flow.
Our current understanding of the beginning of the Universe starts 10 millionths of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a second (10-43 seconds) after the Big Bang.
The Universe expanded somewhat slowly at this point, but its temperature was extraordinarily high: at least 100,000 billion billion billion (1032) degrees.
The cooling rate was extremely rapid, however, and only 100 billionth of a second later, its temperature had already dropped to 100 billion (1011) degrees!
A spectacular event then occurred: the size of the Universe abruptly multiplied by 1050 times (that’s 100 billion trillion trillion, or a 1 followed by 50 zeroes).
The Universe was still extremely hot so the particles were much too agitated to combine with each other and form atoms.
All this would change 300,000 years after the Big Bang when the temperature of the Universe had fallen to a mere 3,000 degrees.
At this temperature, the movements of subatomic particles were sufficiently slow that the first atoms could finally form.
Electrons—which up to this point had been spending their existence capturing and releasing photons—were now tied up with atomic nuclei (protons and neutrons) to create these first atoms.
Finally freed from their struggle with the electrons, photons began to move throughout space to create the earliest light energy: cosmic background radiation.
Video sequence Hubert Reeves explains that the Universe has a history.
Astronomers Space Time The arrangement of matter The arrangement of matter As the Universe cooled, matter became more complex After the Big Bang, the temperature of the Universe continually dropped as matter organized itself into increasingly complex forms.
At the grand scale, the cosmos was initially filled with a homogenous gas consisting mainly of light chemical elements.
At long last, the Universe ceased to be dark as it began to fill with stars that would eventually combine to form galaxies.
It was in the core of these first stars (and all stars since then) that heavier chemical elements—like carbon, oxygen, silicon and iron—began to form via nuclear reactions.
At the end of each star’s life cycle, these "new" chemical elements were released into space where they enriched the clouds of interstellar gas.
Gravitational forces eventually regrouped the matter in these clouds to create a new generation of stars.
The life cycle of stars is responsible for adding all kinds of chemical elements to the Universe.
Under very special conditions, it is even possible for atoms in the space between stars to combine with other atoms and form simple molecules, or even complex molecules like amino acids.
Some stars gain planets after being born.
Planets can be terrestrial (that is, made mainly of metal and rock like the Earth and Mars), whereas others are made mostly of gases, like Jupiter and Saturn, or ice, which is probably the case for Pluto.
The Earth is a peculiar case because water can exist in liquid form.
Thanks to this simple fact, it was possible for organic molecules (those consisting of carbon atoms) to arrange in complex enough patterns to allow life to form.
Although we are fairly certain that life began on Earth at least 3 billion 800 years ago, we still know very little about the conditions that allowed life to originate.
Astronomers Equipment and preparation How does a star finder work?
Equipment and preparation Astronomy is both a science and a pastime that can be practiced using only basic equipment and without being an expert The rewards of astronomy were never more accessible than they are today.
The recent profusion of spectacular images, the explosion of knowledge and technical possibilities, the ubiquitous presence of the Internet, and the widespread accessibility to equipment have catapulted popular astronomy into a new era.
Astronomy can be practiced during the day or night.
In the daytime, it is possible to observe the Moon, several planets, and our own star, the Sun.
It is dangerous to view the Sun directly.
Instead, you should project its image onto a cardboard screen using binoculars or a telescope, or install special filters onto a telescope before looking through it.
Solar spots, which are dark regions on the Sun’s surface, are easily seen when viewing the Sun using these methods.
Bring a notebook and pencil to take notes.
A flashlight with a red filter will help you see your way in the dark without blinding your friends or yourself.
Now that you are all set up, familiarize yourself with the constellations using only your eyes: constellations help guide us to the celestial objects we wish to observe.
Once you have learned to orient yourself, binoculars will be very helpful – even professional astronomers commonly use them.
Mounted on a tripod, binoculars provide magnificent celestial vistas, revealing the topography of the Moon, the moons of Jupiter, a good number of nebulas, and even some galaxies.
At some point, you will want to add a refracting or reflecting telescope to push your observations to the next level.
The most important feature of a telescope is its optical precision of its optical components.
Look for well-known brands that have established and reliable reputations.
Newtonian-type telescopes are generally more affordable due to their simple design.
At the other end of the spectrum are amateur telescopes that are as powerful as those used by professionals thanks to computers and CCD cameras.
In some cases, the telescope can be left outside while you make your observations from inside, comfortably seated in front of your computer.
Luckily for those who do not own a telescope, there are many astronomy clubs with members who share a passion for space and are more than happy to let others look through their telescopes.
Do not hesitate to contact an astronomy club: the people are invariably a very welcoming bunch.
How does a star finder work?
An indispensable sky map A star finder (also known as a planisphere) is a circular map with an overlay that turns to show – through an opening in the overlay – the region of the sky that is visible for a specified time, date and location.
It is an incredibly useful tool for orienting yourself in the night sky, for identifying constellations, and for planning your stargazing night.
For southern Canada, a star finder designed for 45E north is sufficient.
The way a star finder works is simple.
The days and months of the year are shown around the edge of a circular base, and the hours of the day are displayed around the overlay.
By turning the overlay to line up the time of your observations with the date, the portion o the sky that is visible will appear through the opening in the overlay.
All that remains is to hold the star finder over your head and orient it with respect to North.
Instructions The activity simulates a real star search.
Simply click the hour you want and then drag the mouse over the circle in the middle and indicate the date and precise hour that you intend to search the sky overhead.
A precise representation of the sky at that precise moment may be viewed onscreen.
Use the star searcher to pinpoint stars, constellations and planets precisely.
Then wait for a starry night to use your star searcher to locate the constellations and stars that fill our sky.
The ASTROLab thanks the National Research Council of Canada for permission to use their electronic planisphere and to allow us to develop an interactive version of it.

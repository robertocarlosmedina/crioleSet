Do you want to go?
I'm not going, because it's too late
And I don't feel like much.
Me either.
Sapphire, how are you?
I have a doubt to add more data to the project.
Why?
I am not very well understood that story of the models and the submodels
In the servmain.py file
That, we have to mark to see, so we can exclaim them.
Have you stopped going to Calhau?
Not yet, this week here.
Because, now I've started working on Saturday
complicated then
And when I stop going to Calhau, I will start going to driving classes.
Now it can only be on Sundays.
But the libraries do not open.
Yes, this is the detail of Sundays
But for me it can even be on the street.
You will explain that part there to me.
Good morning, thank you, I saw that you made me some translations.
I made him thirsty. He got tired of lying down.
You and Stitxe are just crazy.
His brother filled here with the smell of perfume. Very good.
You are crazy
If you get home before 5 am, it's not to enter the room, please.
Then I explain to you why.
YH. Are you tidying up the room?
Then I explain to you
You can come when you want
Are you already at home?
É qual escola, mesmo?
Pintim, next to Ludjer.
Those of green uniform.
This is what we need
Did you see those two?
One is to generate Dungeon type maps. The other is for open spaces and characters.
But for those things there we need more potent computers.
Ours would stop in the first rendering.
If you can, bring me a little bread. I didn't eat at home.
You're welcome.
Sorry to close the phone like that. I didn't know if you would say more.
I said that to her.
What did she say?
It is not to say that she did as if nothing happened.
It's not for you to tell me she acted like nothing happened.
As I wasn't sure if he entered. I told her that I just saw him move away from that door.
Like I wasn't sure if he got in. I told her I just saw him walk away from that door.
But I got the impression that Shippy was barking with an open door.
She just thanked it. And for me to always be aware.
She just said thanks. And for me to always be attentive.
I knew, this is always how she does.
Now it's if something disappears, that she'll realize who it is.
Wait and you will see how she will disregard it.
I was boring to tell you. But I couldn't ignore this situation.
And even you yourself will be surprised.
And if it were me, I wouldn't even think twice about telling him, and before I tell him I would talk to António right away.
And look, I told him that I heard Shippy barking very loudly and that the door could be open. But she told me that Shippy barks with the door closed.
As I told you, boy, like Ricardo, he reveals these things there.
And if the door was closed, he wouldn't "fly" out of there.
But deep down she knows, only she doesn't want to assume.
But deep down she knows, only she doesn't want to admit it.
He was wearing a coat and cap.
Do you have access to the cameras?
I have yes, why?
Just look there, because I'm not sure. Because I had a time when I was watching outside the door and there was no one there.
Out of nowhere I hear him to bark.
And when I opened the door another time I saw him come out.
But inside the house there are no cameras, only outside.
But did you see him close the door?
I saw him coming out of there. And hear the noise of iron things spinning. But I didn't see him closing it.
But did he enter inside or not?
I don't know. Everything is suspicious and everything kind of indicates it
But I didn't see if he left the room, right in front of the door. And that's when he heard me open the door to our room.
And did you hear him calling Carmelinda?
Not. Just beating. And it was low. First time I was in doubt. But then I lowered the volume and listened.
Hmm, this way of hitting is interesting.
Yes sir
It was just after I heard him knock that I opened the door, but I didn't see anyone there.
After about 5 to 10 minutes, Shippy started to bark a lot.
I opened the door and saw him go out that way. I don't think he even knows if I've seen him or not.
Shippy wouldn't bark like that if it was nothing.
I hope there is no next time. But if there is a next one, I will go out with the phone to record.
I am relaxed anyway. Even if a little embarrassed.
You, it's not with you, just relax in your corner anymore.
At least you warned.
I'm around here in One Peice. To see what will become of the wedding.
In a moment I will put you at speed 2.0
In a little while I will put it on speed 2.0
I'm here listening to music and waiting for some guests.
As? you work?
Yes, why?
Usually after 2 hours of work you sleep.
That was what they said.
But I will stay until Monday
Until Sunday
Monday you have things to do
I even left Marlisa, she said she will leave Carla a message.
I don't know why, but anyway.
Because as I had said, I'm already determined.
It seems that the owner is her.
How, are you already making your own decisions? Have you already screwed up?
In 1 month is practical class. Then the fun will start.
I just want to see me and you there.
It will probably be on different days.
But it will be really quiet.
I can't imagine you driving.
Let me know in those days, so I will move away from the roads.
We'll see ourselves then
I want to see you too
I am like the faces of Fast and Furious, but much better
I want to see
I see it right away, but it looks like a very interesting course.
Yes it is.
I'm really enjoying
I identify with him too
Even so, it is important that you like
I'm fine just here
You didn't come to do the internship at Nosi, no???
I'm not finished yet. I'm doing my final work.
But in August I will do a year of professional internship.
And also I work in a company here in SV of some Germans
I saw that some guys would start internship there on Nosi on the 1st.
Hm ok, but I didn't apply or anything
Also, my internship is almost over.
Can only be a contract of employment
Now, I'm planning to go to Calheta on the big holidays
And how about this school?
Okay, by chance
if you see him, please say so, that I wish him well and give him strength.
Good afternoon, look when can you help me in that thing?
We've run enough for one day.
Were you at home all morning?
Were you looking at her legs?
What Tom did was very stupid.
What are my responsibilities?
What are the neighbors doing?
We went to the beach to swim.
We were at a loss what to do.
We were born on the same day.
We were up all night talking.
We weren't talking about you.
We will be living in England.
We will make up for the loss.
We work every day but Sunday.
We need more people like Tom.
We need to protect ourselves.
We need to water the flowers.
We played baseball yesterday.
We really do need Tom's help.
We saw smoke in the distance.
They're traitors.
They've all left.
Things got weird.
This and no more.
This bed is cold.
This book is new.
Thank you kindly.
Thanks a million.
Thanks very much.
That book is old.
That car is hers.
That didn't work.
That explains it.
People are dying.
People will talk.
Pets are allowed.
Please answer me.
Please be honest.
Please be polite.
Please come here.
May I smoke here?
Be careful, Tom!
Are you kidding?
Are you looking?
Are you married?
Are you nervous?
Are you on dope?
Are you relaxed?
Yes, I know it.
She adores him.
